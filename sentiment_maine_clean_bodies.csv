1,9317,Cleaning Maine’s Coastal Waters: Are Seaweed Gardens the Answer? | Maine Public,"BOOTHBAY, Maine — Seaweed cultivation has been promoted in recent years in Maine as a way to produce local nutritious food and to boost the coastal economy. Now, seaweed harvesters say their industry provides yet another benefit: environmental protection, in the form of improving water quality. A new study from Bigelow Laboratory for Marine Sciences in Boothbay indicates growing and harvesting seaweed may be an antidote for increasing carbon and acidity levels in the ocean, which is harming a variety of marine life. Since January 2016, the lab has been studying the effect of kelp growth on surrounding carbon levels at the Ocean Approved seaweed farm off Great Chebeague Island in Casco Bay. The early results indicate that sugar kelp absorbs carbon from the surrounding water as it grows. This is prompting the lab to expand its research on kelp and to conduct a separate study on the carbon-absorption abilities of wild-grown rockweed. Kelp is a long, flat, leathery type of seaweed that creates “forests” where it grows in bunches below the low tide line. Rockweed is a shorter, more tangled plant that attaches to rocks both in the intertidal zone and below the low tide line. “Our research indicates that sugar kelp absorbs incredible amounts of carbon as it grows, creating a ‘halo’ of higher water quality around it,” said Nichole Price, a senior research scientist at the lab and the director of the lab’s Center for Seafood Security. According to Price, in the six months that scientists measured carbon dioxide levels in and around the 3-acre kelp farm, they found the kelp was absorbing carbon at the same rate carbon levels are expected to increase in the Gulf of Maine over the next 100 years from global use of fossil fuels. The initial findings are significant because increasing carbon levels are making the ocean more acidic. Higher carbon levels in the marine environment are linked to temperature-related die-offs of coral reefs, shift in species distribution as fish seek out colder waters richer in oxygen, and the spread of shell disease among lobster, primarily off the southern New England coast. Acidification resulting from higher carbon levels also poses a threat to bivalve shellfish species such as oysters, mussels, scallops and clams, all of which are commercially grown and harvested in Maine waters. Economic impact  In 2015, the most recent year statistics are available for Maine, commercially harvested oysters, clams, mussels, scallops, etc., accounted for more than $36 million in revenue, of which more than $22 million came from softshell clams alone, according to Maine Department of Marine Resources. The $36 million total represents nearly a $15 million increase since 2010, when the total statewide landings value of those same marine bivalve species was $21.7 million. Over that same period, the volume of those harvests decreased by more than 3 million pounds, from 12.3 million pounds in 2010 to less than 9 million pounds in 2015. “The importance [that harvesting seaweed will have] to the shellfish industry will only increase,” Price said. The annual value of Maine’s seaweed harvest has held steady, hovering between about $500,000 and $750,000 since 2011, state statistics indicate. Over that same time period, the volume of Maine’s annual seaweed harvest has been at historic highs, remaining above 15 million pounds each year over the past five years. Seaweed cultivation in Maine has been paired with fish and shellfish aquaculture for years, according to people familiar with the industry. Shep Erhart of Maine Coast Sea Vegetables, who serves as president of the Maine Seaweed Council, said seaweed has aided salmon and other finfish aquaculture because it absorbs the high level of nitrogen within the excrement released by the schools. Ocean nitrogen also tends to be high in areas where agricultural runoff drains into the sea, according to Price, which led shellfish growers to use seaweed in their operations, too. But in Maine, where the impact of agriculture on coastal waters is relatively low compared to other states, the seaweed appeared to have less impact on nitrogen levels and more of a general positive impact on the health of the shellfish being cultivated, she said. “We don’t have the type of agriculture runoff problems that the mid-Atlantic [shoreline] does,” Price said. But the Gulf of Maine’s does have comparatively lower temperatures, she added, which makes it more susceptible to carbon absorption. Erhart said Bigelow Lab’s research is the first scientific evidence of which he’s aware that demonstrates seaweed cultivation and harvests can reduce carbon levels. Large-scale harvesting of seaweed then, like clear-cutting forests on land, likely would have an overall negative impact, he added. “The seaweed is actually giving something back” to the balance of the coastal marine environment, Erhart said. “Taking some of it on a regular basis in moderation can help with the larger issue of ocean acidification.” Growth stage is key  According to Price, the lab’s key finding is that the carbon-absorption of kelp corresponds to its stages of growth. Sugar kelp has a life cycle of only about two years, and it grows the most in the spring. It is during this heavy growth period that kelp absorbs carbon, which it later releases into the water as it ages and dies, she said. This is why harvesting the kelp is deemed important. Removing mature kelp and ‘planting’ new stalks — cultivated in land-based nurseries before being transferred to lease sites — ensures that carbon captured by the growing kelp is not released later, according to Price. Bigelow Lab now plans this year to measure carbon levels in the ocean around its lease site by using a boat outfitted with carbon sensors to take readings in concentric circles around the site off Great Chebeague, which will help scientists determine how the rate of carbon absorption changes with distance from the kelp beds. The lab also plans to use money from the Department of Marine Resources’ seaweed management fund, which is funded by harvester license fees, to research carbon absorption rates for rockweed. If the studies are promising, she said, the lab hopes to raise money for field research on rockweed in 2018. Hale Miller, a lobsterman who fishes out of Tenants Harbor, also has been harvesting rockweed for the past year or so. He typically cuts several thousand wet pounds of the seaweed species per day, four or five days per week, often along the Muscle Ridge Islands in Penobscot Bay. He does it during the winter, when he hauls his lobster traps out of the water and waits for the crustaceans to return back toward shore in the spring. Miller said part of his interest in harvesting rockweed, aside from the extra money, is the ecological benefit along the shoreline. The shallow water near the coast serves as a nursery for a variety of commercially harvested marine species, he said, and reducing water carbon levels there would help a variety of different creatures. “It’s affecting lobsters, it’s affecting scallops, it affects groundfish,” Miller said of ocean acidification. “[Seaweed harvesting] will help across the board — oyster aquaculture, the estuaries, everything.” Miller added that rules for harvesting wild rockweed are aimed at sustainability. The state requires harvesters leave at least 16 inches of the plant attached to the bottom when they cut the stalk, he said, which often results in the plants growing back more densely. “We’re leaving a significant amount of product on the bottom,” Miller said. “It’s kind of like ‘v’-notching [egg-bearing lobsters and throwing them back overboard]. It think it’s a good thing.”",bad,seaweed aquaculture,2017,Maine
2,9324,Island School Students Learn Ocean Science By Growing Kelp | Maine Public,"PORTLAND, Maine (AP) _ Students in Maine who have been learning about marine science will conclude their project by dropping kelp-growing lines in the water at the start of the winter growing season. The Peaks Island Elementary students have been participating in a program called KELP4KIDS. KELP4KIDS is a 12-week curriculum for second- through fifth-graders at the island school. Kelp is grown as a crop in Maine for use in food and other products. The Island Institute Education Director Yvonne Thomas says the students have been learning about how kelp aquaculture improves water quality and absorbs carbon dioxide in the ocean. They’ll drop lines Friday. Baxter Academy for Technology and Science senior Emma Christman has been working with the school and the Island Institute to teach students about marine life and the environment. The program resumes in spring.

3,9332,'Aquaculture's Next Wave' Explores How Maine Entrepreneurs Are Navigating Changing Seas | Maine Public,"   This week we’re taking a deep dive into aquaculture and its potential to add real value to the state’s coastal economies. In “Aquaculture’s Next Wave” we will meet the innovators who are trying to take seafood farming to a new level in Maine. Worldwide, aquaculture now provides more than half the world’s seafood. Yet here in the U.S. and in Maine, it’s far behind wild caught harvest. At the same time, we in the U.S. import roughly 90 percent of our seafood. For some investors and entrepreneurs, including Maine lobstermen, that spells opportunity. Maine Public reporter Fred Bever spoke with Morning Edition host Irwin Gratz about aggressive exploration of new technologies and new markets for farmed seafood.  Gratz: Why is aquaculture important right now' Bever: It’s because marine ecosystems and economies are being disrupted. Actively farming fish, shellfish, even seaweed — that can be a hedge against disruption and, long term, maybe the most profitable response. There’s a growing set of Maine visionaries who are pursuing that. The planet’s oceans are always in flux and wild harvests have long been vulnerable to natural variation and overfishing, right' Yes, but with the oceans warming, the dynamics are accelerating, and that’s nowhere more true than in the Gulf of Maine. Scientists say the Gulf is warming faster than 99 percent of the world’s oceans, correct' That’s almost a truism now. We’ve seen epic disruptions in recent decades — the crash of cod, fisheries for marine shrimp, for urchin and now herring are all restricted, lobster populations are making a slow march ever north and east following the warming trends. That’s been good for Maine lobstermen, and for the state, correct' Absolutely. But scientists and even some lobstermen, like Jeff Putnam, who fishes 800 traps from Chebeague Island year round, worry that the boom will bust. Here he is: “Just got to the point where I was a little concerned that if something happens to the lobster resource that’s beyond our control, how am I going to make a living on this island for the next 20 or 30 years'” That’s why he started an oyster farm in a little cove on Chebeague just a couple of years ago. He’s teaching his kids how to lobster, sure, but also how to grow oysters. He wants them to be able to make a living on the island just as he and his father did. But it’s not just lobstermen who are taking up aquaculture' It’s entrepreneurs of all varieties, from young Mainers who are looking to build a future at home to international investors who are looking for new revenue streams, and big ones. Oysters have been a big story. Maine’s oyster production tripled over the last decade, right through the recession. But even oysters face some environmental challenges. We’ll be looking at one oyster grower who’s leveraging cutting-edge technology to protect his crop. He’s even trying to use it to get a leg up on his competitors. And new tech spells new opportunity. Yes, and the cool tech factor was almost everywhere I looked in reporting these stories. Scallop farmers adapting Japanese machinery to increase production, clean rooms where these massive vats of microscopic sea plants are grown entirely in the dark. You know those tiny glass eels that Maine fishermen are making bank on by shipping them to Japan' The Japanese grow them up to full size make them into sushi. Yes, well there’s a young woman in Maine who’s designing and building the first commercial eel growing operation in the U.S., over in midcoast. There are not one but two companies trying to scale up indoor salmon growing tech. So far they say they could supply more than a tenth of the country’s entire salmon consumption, if their home communities let them. That’s another part of this story. Conflict over aquaculture’s expansion. If the sector is to grow as much in Maine as some would hope, there’s going to be tension over public resources. Is there room on the water for everyone' Will shorefront retirees give up their coastal serenity' Where does all the fish poop end up' I spoke with one booster, Sebastian Bell, who runs the Maine Aquaculture Association. He says the sector is poised to grow as fast as 10 or 12 percent a year. But he says don’t suspect a sudden and unsustainable boom: “Aquaculture will be one of a number of solutions that will help the working waterfront survive in Maine. But it takes time to learn the skills that are needed for a new way to make a living, it takes time to build those businesses.” And that’s one of the most fascinating things about the sector. Entrepreneurs here in Maine are experimenting with a whole bunch of new ways to make a living from the changing seas around us.

4,9333,"‘The Wave Of The Future Is Breaking, Right Here In Maine’ - Aquaculture And Maine Entrepreneurs | Maine Public","Maine's 21st century saltwater farmers are using new techniques and technology to produce scallops, oysters, salmon and eels — to name just a few. All this week Maine Public Radio is profiling innovators who want to take Maine's aquaculture industry to the next level.  Maine Public reporter Fred Bever has spent some time with these entrepreneurs, reporting for our series, ""Aquaculture's Next Wave."" He joined Nora Flaherty on Maine Things Considered to discuss the project.  Flaherty: Fred, you've been doing a lot of reporting on this. What's the bottom line' Bever: The bottom line is that Maine fishermen are increasingly turning to farming fish and shellfish as a hedge against uncertainty about the wild fisheries. Now, is that because the Gulf of Maine is warming so fast' Is it overfishing' It's both, and there are other factors, but the Gulf is warming faster than most saltwater bodies on the planet, which is disrupting ecosystems and wild-caught harvests. The herring fishery is recently in trouble — we’ve seen a lot about that in the news lately — but cod, urchin, Maine shrimp, they're all restricted now or completely off-limits. But the warmer waters have been good for lobster populations here and for the lobster industry, right' Incredibly good, we’ve seen record hauls this decade. But an appreciable number of lobstermen are not taking that for granted. Lobster populations are slowly moving north and east, herring for bait are an issue now, and the plight of the North Atlantic right whale threatens to force expensive, and maybe prohibitive, gear changes by fishermen. And many of today's lobstermen used to fish for cod, so they've seen how quickly a business model can sink. That's why Marsden Brewer, a lobsterman I met in Stonington, is branching out to farming scallops: ""You know I've seen the collapse of most of the fisheries...just the way it was set up to work, it wasn't sustainable. And this project here is looking at sustainability."" - Brewer He's adapting Japanese farming techniques and machine’s to Maine's waters. Technological innovation is a big part of what's going on. The wave of the future is breaking, right here in Maine. The Japanese scallop tech is spreading. And there's a young woman Down East who's growing eels to full-size, indoors. That's a technological first in the U.S. An oyster-grower in the Damariscotta estuary just designed and built a whole new facility just to protect his crop against the challenges of climate change. Is the sector really growing that much though' It's dwarfed by the lobster industry, certainly. But there is excitement, it’s palpable. All these advances could mean jobs into the future, particularly for young people who are looking for new ways to make a career in-state, and not just on the water. I saw that when I visited a restaurant called the Shuck Station in Newcastle a few weeks ago. Owner Brendan Parsons is a native Mainer, still in his 20s…He says he's all about aquaculture: ""And obviously I focus on oysters, but then also talking about other aquaculture regarding muscles, experimental scallop farms, seaweed farms, even eel farms."" - Parsons That day [when I spoke to Brendan], the local oyster river-harvest had been shut down because of runoff from some heavy rains. But because of that oyster innovator down the road, Parsons was able to secure a ready supply of fresh-harvested oysters: ""Damn right I did, and they’ve been really pivotal to everything I’ve done."" - Parsons There's really a sense of momentum behind farmed seafood in Maine. But it's not about everyone getting together and singing Kumbaya… Sometimes, but sometimes not, especially when ‘Big Aqua’ tries to move in, it seems. We're seeing that in Belfast, where Norwegian investors are proposing to scale-up indoor salmon farming technology to a new scale, investing millions of dollars, and drawing a lot of local opposition. A forty-acre oyster farm, and that’s pretty big for Maine, is being proposed in the Maquoit Bay, not far from Brunswick. It's getting resistance. We'll look at those kinds of conflicts, and whether there may be limits on just how fast this sector, which depends on public resources, can grow. Well I cannot wait to hear this series, I'm looking forward to it, starting tomorrow on Morning Edition. Thanks Fred.  Thank you, Nora.",good,seaweed aquaculture,2018,Maine
5,9358,Organic Maine Seaweed Firm Wants To Make Your Table Salt Obsolete | Maine Public,"A Gouldsboro organic seaweed aquaculture firm is hoping to lease a site in Frenchman Bay that could help to significantly boost its output. Springtide Seaweed, a company founded in 2017, already operates a 35-acre cultivation site in the bay, off Preble Island in Sorrento. If it is granted a lease for a 20-acre site off Stave Island, it could triple the annual output of its finished, dry product to 75,000 pounds, according to company officials. The company has applied to the Maine Department of Marine Resources for a 10-year lease for a site west of Stave Island. On Tuesday, a public hearing on the application was held at the town office in Gouldsboro. None of the half dozen members of the public who attended the half-hour hearing raised any objections to the proposal. The state is expected to make a decision on the lease application within 120 days, according to DMR’s Flora Drury. Springtide Seaweed grows mainly kelp but also is developing products from dulse and nori seaweed varieties, according to Sarah Redmond, founder of the company. The firm converts the kelp into different products at its processing site in the village of South Gouldsboro, which the company just moved into last year. Among its products are powders that can be used as culinary seasonings and salt substitutes. Redmond, a longtime associate with the federal Sea Grant program, said Tuesday that she has been involved in seaweed aquaculture since 2010 and continues to develop methods for seaweed cultivation at the University of Maine’s Center for Cooperative Aquaculture Research in Franklin. “I want kelp on every table in America,” she said. “It is nature’s true healthy salt.” Redmond said there is a lot of room for growth in Maine’s aquaculture industry, and that it can be done sustainably without competing with other marine activities. Operations at the Frenchman Bay site would take place from September through the end of June, with seaweed growing through the winter, Redmond said. The seasonality of the operation would help minimize conflicts with lobstermen, who tend to set traps near shore in the summer but further out to sea in the fall, when lobster fishing is heaviest, she said. “Most of the activity takes place in the spring when you have to harvest the lines,” she said. In the fall, the lines will be seeded with seaweed spat that the company cultivates on land. The lines — nine in all — would measure about 1,000 feet long and would run parallel to each other and to the surface of the water. A recent petition submitted by lobstermen to state officials about limiting aquaculture operations shows how important it is to find lease sites that have little to no impact on other marine activities, Redmond said. “Anyone that applies for an aquaculture lease should take a lot of time to understand what the [surrounding] uses are and where their proposed efforts will fit into that waterfront,” Redmond said. “We have a significant amount of water out there, but there are a lot of people to work with. I think site selection is one of the most important things we can do to avoid these conflicts.” She was particularly interested in the site west of Stave Island because in 2012 it was approved for use as a cod farm that never materialized, she said. When that proposal was submitted to DMR, no one raised any objections. “It isn’t an area that is heavily utilized,” Redmond said. Springtide also is partnering with College of the Atlantic in Bar Harbor, where it has helped students learn about organic seaweed cultivation and hopes to develop a wet research lab. She said she wants to share what she has learned about organic seaweed aquaculture and help the industry grow and be sustainable. “We very much want to partner with them,” Redmond said. “If we had more people working with food systems in the ocean, I think we’d have a lot more attention being paid to water quality, to impacts of other activities in Bar Harbor and around the bay, and that’s really important.”",bad,seaweed aquaculture,2019,Maine
6,9372,"As The Gulf Of Maine Warms, Lobstermen Explore Different Fisheries | Maine Public","In 30 years, the Gulf of Maine will have been transformed by climate change. Its waters will inexorably grow warmer, and the species that flourish there will be those that can adapt. The same might be said for the Mainers who make their living from the sea. The future of the state's marine economy may well belong to those who can adapt.  A little over a year ago, reporter Fred Bever visited a small estuary on the far side of Chebeague Island, where lobsterman Jeff Putnam was working on a little side-business. ""These are oysters that I started just this year,' Putnam said at the time. Putnam established the Sandy Point oyster farm to add a new revenue stream to his business, and, he says, provide future options for his children. ""Hopefully the lobster resource will still be strong when they grow up, and that will be there and that will be an option but there's certainly no guarantee that's the case' he said. So I wanted to show them there is another way to make a living."" With the state's lobster harvest now appearing to fall off from recent record levels, Bever called Jeff this week to see how the oysters are coming along. ""It's going well. I've sold some to a local fish market here in Yarmouth, Dave's Seafood,' Putnam says. I love it, I really do. It's awesome."" That puts him in a small but growing phalanx of lobstermen trying out new ways to preserve a career and culture amid change that scientists say is well under way in the Gulf of Maine.  Researchers say warming water temperatures projected over the next 30 years could reduce the Gulf's lobster population by as much as 62 percent as it shifts northward to cooler waters. That worst-case scenario would knock the Maine harvest down to levels seen back in the late 1990s or early 2000s - still better than in earlier decades, but nowhere near the monster hauls of the past ten years. And it's not just lobster that will be edging out of the picture. ""We expect to see quite substantial declines in a number of groundfish species like cod, haddock, pollock. So the species that have typically formed the base of many of our fisheries in this region,"" says Kathy Mills, a scientist at the Gulf of Maine Research Institute. Mills is modeling what will happen to more than 50 Atlantic marine species in the Gulf by 2055 - and what that could mean for ports up and down the coast - from Point Judith, Rhode Island, to Stonington, Maine. ""And how that relates to their current dependence on fisheries,' she says. What are they currently harvesting' How will they be affected by these changes' And, also, what new species might be moving in that provide new opportunities in the future'"" Take Stonington, the unrivaled king of the lobster boom. The port's 250-plus fishermen this decade routinely brought in more than $40 million worth per year. Mills says early runs of her models predict that the lobster population near Stonington could drop off by some 20 percent. Other fisheries, such as herring and halibut, will also decline. And, assuming the lobstermen stick to their habitual ways of fishing, profits could fall by more than half.  That could lead to exits from the fishing business, consolidation, and financial disaster for fishermen with big loans on their boats. But, there will be other opportunities, as more southerly species follow the warming temperatures up the coast. ""Black sea bass and squid, those are consistently increasing,' says Mills. Scup, butterfish and potentially some of the crab species, so like rock crabs for example."" Warming waters are also expected to expand the range of some aquaculture crops, including oysters and quahogs - although problematic predators such as the invasive green crab are benefited as well. Mills says that if fishing communities like Stonington play it right and aggressively adapt to the ecosystem shifts, profits, in many cases, can stay near the levels seen through the boom years this decade. And some lobstermen in Stonington are already on board. ""So one of the things that I've been thinking about for quite a few years is squid,' says Stonington lobsterman Genevieve McDonald. McDonald says that back in 2012, when the Gulf hit new records for warm temperatures, longfin squid suddenly turned up in abundance. So now she's thinking about how to take advantage of that - and about what type of gear and infrastructure she would need to catch squid and get them to market. McDonald says her husband's family still has an ice-house they once used for preserving groundfish, such as cod, back before those fisheries crashed. ""You actually might be going back to what will, at that point, be historical knowledge,' she says. And so when your talking about black sea bass or squid, you're no longer dealing with a live product, so you go back to icing fish and shipping them to New York or Boston.""  Another key issue is getting permission to fish for squid, sea bass and other emerging species. In federal waters, three miles and more for offshore fisheries are ruled by federal quotas, and it may be difficult to get Rhode Island, for instance, to give up quota so that Mainers can capture a new share of squid. McDonald, who is also a state representative on the Legislature's Marine Resources Committee, says Maine fishermen should first focus on inshore waters and encourage state regulators to start designing regulations for emerging fisheries. ""Because it's not your grandfather's fishery anymore. We're really hitting a point where if you want to succeed, you're going to have to be involved in management and you're going to have to know what's coming."" But while lobster harvesters are thinking ahead, many remain focused on the fishery they know. And Carla Guenther, chief scientist at the Maine Center for Coastal Fisheries in Stonington, cautions that all the hype about long-term lobster decline is leaving some fishermen feeling helpless. ""Just pounding in the press about how climate change is going to threaten the lobster fishery, it's paralyzing,' Guenther says.

And as long as we're thinking creatively about how we can achieve diversification that's going to be what we survive on.' Jeff Putnam, the Chebeague lobsterman experimenting with oysters, is firmly, if cautiously, on that path. ""I don't plan to expand too much with just oysters.

I plan to look into the kelp business a little bit."" And, Putnam says, he'll keep on lobstering full-time, year round.",bad,seaweed aquaculture,2019,Maine
8,9386,Aquaculture Businesses Now Eligible For Pandemic Relief Funds | Maine Public,"Shellfish and seaweed growers in Maine are in line for a new round of federal coronavirus relief funds. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue says the USDA is expanding the list of producers who can qualify for its Coronavirus Food Assistance Program to include aquaculture businesses nationwide.  The executive director of the Maine Aquaculture Association, Sebastian Belle, says the state’s growing aquaculture sector missed out on the program’s initial funding, but now can join farmers and ranchers to apply for a share of the latest $14 billion allotment. “The impact on particularly our shellfish growers was so big in the marketplace that we knew particularly some of the new smaller growers were likely not to going survive this. And that’s what really drove our advocacy with the delegation and at the national level with the secretary,” he says. Belle is crediting U.S. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, in particular, for a sustained push on the USDA to expand eligibility to several “specialty” crops, which could include some blueberry operations. Belle says that for qualifying aquaculture the assistance should be significant, but the details have yet to be released.",good,seaweed aquaculture,2020,Maine
9,9389,"Budding Maine Urchin Industry Gets $100,000 Boost From USDA | Maine Public","A grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture is expected to boost efforts to create a viable sea-urchin aquaculture sector in the Gulf of Maine. Maine’s wild urchin fishery is still tightly regulated after being overharvested decades ago. Steve Eddy, director of the University of Maine’s Center for Cooperative Aquaculture Research, says oyster and seaweed farmers could benefit by adding urchins to their crops for sale to Asian markets or live delivery to American restaurants. “In Japan and maybe like France and Greece, some parts of Europe, where people buy live, whole urchins, they will pay $2, $3, as much as $5 per animal,” he says. Wholesale prices would likely be lower. But before a Gulf of Maine urchin aquaculture sector could get up and running, Eddy says, methods for hatching and growing seedlings will need to be improved. The $100,000 federal grant will enhance techniques already under development at the university research station in Franklin.",good,seaweed aquaculture,2021,Maine
10,9390,Maine Startup Aims To Pull Carbon Out Of The Atmosphere By Growing — And Then Sinking — Kelp Farms | Maine Public,"The fight against climate change has long focused on scaling back humanity’s emissions of planet-warming carbon-dioxide. But a movement is growing to think bigger and find ways to actually pull existing CO2 out of the air and lock it up somewhere safe. One Maine startup has an innovative approach that’s drawing attention from scientists and investors: grow massive amounts of seaweed and then bury it at the bottom of the deepest sea, where it will sequester carbon for thousands of years. On a fishing boat a few miles out in the Gulf of Maine, Capt. Rob Odlin and Adam Rich are tossing buoys into the water. Each is tethered to a rope entwined with tiny seeds of kelp, a fast-growing seaweed. “We’re just fishing for carbon now, and kelp’s the net,” Odlin says. The project is experimental R&D for a company called Running Tide Technologies, based on the Portland waterfront. Marty Odlin, the boat captain’s nephew and the CEO of Running Tide, explains the company’s mission.  “Essentially what we have to do is run the oil industry in reverse,” he says. Odlin wants to mimic the natural processes that turned ancient plants into carbon-storing fossil fuels — and do it in a hurry. He sees individual kelp microfarms floating hundreds of miles offshore, over the deepest parts of the world’s oceans. The kelp soaks up carbon, via photosynthesis, and grows. After about seven months, the mature blades get too heavy for their biodegradable buoys, and sink. “The kelp will sink to the ocean bottom in the sediment, and become, essentially, part of the ocean floor,” Odlin says. “That gets you millions of years of sequestration. So that’s when you’re making oil. That’s got to be the ultimate goal.” This year’s goal is more modest: just 1,600 buoys deployed to demonstrate that in principle, the system could safely and economically be expanded to a global scale: millions of microfarms floating in the open sea, moving billions of tons of carbon from sky to ocean floor every year. “On geologic time scales it can remove 400 gigatons, 800 gigatons of carbon from the atmosphere. That will happen. So what we’re trying to do is just give it a nudge, and accelerate it,” Odlin says.  With climate change’s effects accelerating, deep-pocketed corporations are setting aggressive goals to offset their emissions. Some, like Microsoft, are pledging to go carbon negative, pulling more CO2 from the air than the company’s operations have emitted since its founding. Last year Microsoft pledged $1 billion to the effort, and some of that money will be used to purchase carbon offset credits generated by large sequestration projects. High-tech innovations are emerging around the world: Towering banks of fans that can pull CO2 from the sky; pumps injecting plant-based biofuels into the Earth. But Running Tide seems to be capturing attention, and investment, because of its low-tech elegance. “When we started learning about Running Tide’s approach, I was blown away by the simplicity,” says Stacy Kauk, who directs sustainability efforts at Shopify, a $150-billion e-commerce company. Venture capital funds have already invested millions in Running Tide. But Shopify will be the first to buy carbon-offset credits from the company as part of its corporate commitment to address climate change. Kauk says the approach holds unique promise for rapid, even exponential growth, and at a price that businesses and governments that aim to “decarbonize” their economies could afford, while making a profit for the entrepreneurs.  “They’re not relying on expensive equipment, or energy-intensive processes. It’s very simple, and the economies of scale associated with that make Running Tide’s solution have huge potential,” she says. If the technology were to reach that potential though, it could bring problems. What might happen, after all, when a multitude of little kelp farms floats free' “We need to basically catalog all of the possible environmental impacts,” says Brad Ack, who directs Ocean Visions, a consortium of top research institutions such as MIT, the Smithsonian Institution and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. This month, the group chose Running Tide as the first carbon-removal project that it would advise and evaluate. That vetting includes analysis of potential environmental damage — whether rope might entangle whales, whether bunched-up microfarms might hinder shipping traffic. And what happens to seafloor ecosystems when they receive a big pulse of biomass from above' “But we have to compare them against the no-action alternative,” he says, “and in this case, the no-action alternative is very grim.” Odlin says it will take a World War II-level effort to knock back CO2 levels in the Earth’s atmosphere to something like a preindustrial state, through his and other big-thinking projects. You could reopen all of Maine’s defunct paper mills, he says, just to produce the biodegradable buoys needed for the Running Tide effort. “Kind of in a cage-match with it at this point. Because if we don’t bring it down, every ecosystem on Earth will face collapse, period,” he says. Running Tide started out a few years ago as a comparatively modest aquaculture operation, focused on restoring oyster habitats. Now its staff has grown to more than 30 engineers, scientists, site workers and mariners. Come spring, they plan to sink the first experimental kelp crop 1,000 meters deep — hopefully to stay there for millennia.",good,seaweed aquaculture,2021,Maine
11,9391,Closed-Pen Salmon Farms Proposed For Frenchman Bay | Maine Public,"A Norwegian investor this month filed applications to establish and operate two 60-acre salmon farms in Frenchman Bay — a proposal that is already drawing fire from local seafood harvesters and landowners. Mikael Roenes says his American Aquafarms company would operate from a former sardine cannery in Gouldsboro, across the bay from Bar Harbor and Acadia National Park. The goal would be to grow as much as 66 million pounds of salmon annually in so-called “closed pens” in the middle of the bay. Company spokesman David Farmer says the technology eliminates salmon escapes, prevents sea lice infestations and better controls waste discharges than traditional open-pen fish farms. “Closed-pen technology is really the cutting edge of ocean-based aquaculture for the future. It is the direction that we’re starting to see Norway move to, and growing interest around the world in this technology,” he says.  The company says it would invest as much as $100 million in the project and create hundreds of jobs. But local opposition is developing among members of the Friends of Frenchman Bay nonprofit group, local lobstermen and smaller-scale aquaculture farmers. “It’s the same water that my crop is in that they would be putting their intensive animal farm in,” says Sarah Redmond, who runs Springtide Seaweed, the nation’s first organically certified kelp farm. Redmond says Maine’s rising number of small-scale aquaculture farms holds promise for substantial economic growth that doesn’t overextend ocean ecosystems. Industrial-scale farms, she says, threaten that future. “We have an incredible place here, and it’s a national treasure. And it’s not an appropriate place to site industrial fish farms, especially as a speculative effort for people from other countries,” she says. Would-be developer Roenes was convicted of participating in an investment fraud worth millions of euros when he was a Norway stockbroker in 2008. According to Norwegian broadcaster NRK he was sentenced to four years in jail. Spokesman David Farmer says Roenes admits past mistakes, but has rebuilt his career and reputation. He says Roenes is confident the project will pass muster with Maine’s departments of Marine Resources and Environmental Protection.",bad,seaweed aquaculture,2021,Maine
12,9398,Coastal Entrepreneurs Continue To Ramp Up Maine's Production Of Kelp | Maine Public,"Coastal entrepreneurs continue to ramp up Maine's production of kelp, and a processor that's seeded the young sector's growth is responding by opening a 27,000 square foot plant in Biddeford.  Atlantic Sea Farms CEO Briana Warner says that in the last two seasons, the 24 farmers who supply kelp to the company have increased their landings by 12,000%, to roughly 700,000 pounds of seaweed this year. Most of them are lobstermen who own their own boats, looking for off-season income. ""So our partner farmers constitute around 95 percent of all the seaweed that's grown in the state of Maine, and over 80 percent of what's grown in the entire United States. So what that means is that fishermen are the ones who are singlehandedly growing the kelp industry in the United States, and they're fishermen from Maine,"" Warner says. Before the pandemic, Atlantic Sea Farms was focused mostly on institutional buyers such as food-service companies and restaurant chains. But as those markets slowed or shut down in 2020, Atlantic pivoted to retail buyers for value-added products such as seaweed salad and kelp cubes (for smoothies). The new facility will quadruple the company's processing space, helping to build a critical mass of supply that markets can depend on, Warner says. And that should keep inventory moving from the ocean to institutional buyers and what's now a list of 1,400 retail outlets, and counting, including Whole Foods and Sprouts. Warner adds that balancing supply, demand and processing capacity in a new and fast-growing industry has its challenges but, she says, ""We're selling everything we can grow. We're looking to add more farmers this year, we're working with people that can work off their lobster boats, that can harvest efficiently and effectively and grow high-value seaweed."" In the kelp-harvesting season that wound up last month, Atlantic Sea Farms paid growers 55 cents a pound at the dock, Warner says, noting that the company supplies them seed for free. That's earning them a gross of anywhere from $20,000 to $90,000, and even more, for around 30 days work on the water. Warner says the company is working to pay a price that makes the endeavor worthwhile for fishermen, even while competing with cheaper seaweed grown in Asia. Warner says the company's mission is to diversify income streams for Maine's fleet of owner-operator seafood businesses up and down the coast. ""Kelp is a totally new industry both in the United State and especially on the coast of Maine, and I feel like us moving into a new facility and moving to a bigger place and adding more staff and more marketing and sales and more research and development, and a nursery... it just shows that this is viable and it shows that fishermen can lead a sustainable aquaculture industry,"" Warner says. And, as she notes, because the seaweed-growing season is mostly in the colder months when much of Maine's inshore lobster fleet is dormant, the kelp industry is not beset by the same kind of conflicts that are emerging around expansion, in some places, of the state's shellfish-growing industry.",good,seaweed aquaculture,2021,Maine
13,9399,In Acadia’s Shadow: Latest Flashpoint in Conflict Over Industrial Fish Farms | Maine Public,"A Norwegian investor wants to bring a new kind of fish farm to a stunning, island-studded bay at the base of Acadia’s famous Cadillac Mountain. The project is uniting broad opposition in and around tourist-dependent Mt. Desert Island. The ""American Aquafarms"" project is the latest in a series of industrial-scale fish farms proposed for Maine, highlighting how the nation’s demand for seafood is putting pressure on local marine economies. Frenchman Bay reaches from the eastern side of Mt. Desert Island to the Schoodic peninsula. Through the 20th century, sardine canneries dotted the bay. But the last of them, in Gouldsboro, shut down more than a decade ago. Sardines, and the herring fishery was the biggest fishery for 50 or 60 years and then that declined. But now the only thing left is small fisheries - scallops and all of that. Lobster's the only viable industry. Here at Gouldbsoro's town office, selectman Dana Rice is also the harbormaster and a lobster dealer. He says even the lobster processing company that took over the old harbor sardine plant has had a hard time making it, and waterfront jobs have dwindled. So when a Norwegian investor started sounding out local officials about converting it into a fish hatchery and processing facility for an at-sea salmon farm, Rice was interested. ""I would like to see some good paying jobs for the younger generation... this intrigued me. Hey, they're talking somewhere between $150 million and $350 million investment, you can't turn your back on that. You can not,"" Rice says. American Aquafarms optioned the property two years ago, and since has been laying groundwork for what its backers say will be a state-of-the-art ""closed-pen"" system: an array of enclosed, floating capsules, full of fish, that ostensibly would avoid most of the negative impacts of traditional open-pen salmon farms, such as escapes, disease and pollution. All that while growing as much as 30,000 metric tons of fish a year, enough to serve 5% of the combined U.S. and Canadian markets for Atlantic salmon. ""We're going to need more food production in the future. We can contribute a great deal to that in Maine,"" says Thomas Brennan, American Aquafarms' project development director and a former Poland Spring executive. With American Aquafarms' principles stuck overseas by the pandemic, its de facto man-on-the-ground. He says the venture represents twin benefits: more than a hundred direct jobs and a sustainable way to reduce U.S. dependence on imported seafood, thereby reducing the sector's carbon footprint too.That's right in line with the state's goals for economic recovery, Brennan says, and for battling climate change. Not to mention preserving an historic piece of Maine's dwindling working waterfront. ""I'm afraid we're losing it. And this provides an opportunity to revitalize and area that otherwise may become condos,"" Brennan says. But the project's run into some fiercely-protective citizens and organizations, from conservationists to business owners, who see the bay as a unique and vulnerable resource. People like Sarah Redmond, who four years ago moved into another defunct fish cannery on the other side of the Gouldsboro peninsula. That's where she and a partner established Springtide Seaweed, the nation's first organically-certified grower of kelp - a pioneer in Maine's fast-growing cadre of independent aquaculture farmers. ""So we have a seaweed nursery inside the building in the basement, where we can raise seed for our own farm and other farms. And then we have processing and this is our own boat here. It's really, really essential to have access to the seawater here,"" Redmond says. Redmond steers her skiff out into the bay. Whizzing past undeveloped islands and lines of lobster buoys, she stops about mid-way between Bar Harbor and Gouldsboro, over a deep channel known locally as ""the Hop."" This is the site of one of the two proposed, 60-acre salmon pens. ""We are right at the foot of Acadia National Park. It's just this amazing mountain range that rears up out of the ocean and it's a very, very unique feature on the eastern seaboard. With very little development in this bay, and for the coastline in America and especially in New England, this is very rare,"" Redmond says. Redmond says that while the salmon farm's so-called ""closed-pen"" technology might block most solids - fish poop, that is - from getting into the bay, that's not good enough. They'd still send a big dose of dissolved nitrogen through the pens' permeable membranes, she says, encouraging algal blooms that could harming bay ecosystems, foul her lines and threaten her ""organic"" brand. ""A tremendous influx of nitrogen in a closed bay like this will really upset the balance in the water,"" Redmond says. And Redmond's is just one in a chorus of opposing voices. Conservation groups, project neighbors, local lobstermen and Bar Harbor's tourism industry are all up in arms over various aspects of the project - ecosystem effects yes, but also on-land truck traffic, noise and pollution from on-the water generators, light pollution, odors, navigation hazards posed by the pens and the specialized, hundred-foot boat that would tend them... And overarching all of those, the impacts on what many see as the bay's most charismatic quality - its sheer visual beauty. ""This is going to be something that's very different looking than anything else in Frenchman Bay, there's no question about that,"" says Kevin Schneider, director for the region's largest landowner, Acadia National Park. In the last month he's been increasingly vocal about the concerns he has - although stopping short of putting the Park Service on record as an outright opponent. ""In many respects here in Bar Harbor, our product is the scenery, it's the spectacular landscape. And so the views that visitors see as they are driving Park Loop Road or as they're hiking the trail along the north ridge of Cadillac Mountain. How does it impact those views, those roads, those trails, are all historic,"" Schneider says. The developers insist that they can mitigate these potential problems and meet all federal, state and local requirements. These two proposals, and two others as well, were brought to Maine thanks in part, to work by an economic development non-profit that's financed by some of the state's biggest construction and development firms, called Maine & Co. It's coaxed many big employers here, from T-Mobile to Athena Health to WEX, and CEO Peter DelGreco says big fish farms are simply... having a moment. ""Right now internationally people are looking to the U.S. And Maine can make a lot of sense. We've got 3500 miles of coastline, we're within a one-day truck-drive of a hundred million people 130 million people. And 90 percent of our seafood's imported, we are reacting to what investors are doing.,"" DelGreco says. Project opponents like seaweed farmer Sarah Redmond say it's an approach to economic development that's out of scale with sustainable resource-based economies. ""People know that the coast of Maine is special, because it's one of the last places that isn't industrialized. So to try to build that kind of a system here, it doesn't make any sense,"" Redmond says. And Opponents had a setback last week, when state environmental regulators turned back their request that a citizen review board take jurisdiction over the permitting process. This week Gouldbsboro's board of selectmen voted to seek an independent environmental review of the project. And according to the Ellsworth American, the unanimous vote included the project's heretofore most visible local supporter, Selectman Dana Price. ",bad,seaweed aquaculture,2021,Maine
14,9406,New report sets broad goals for Maine's aquaculture industry in the next decade | Maine Public,"In the last 8 years, Maine’s aquaculture harvest has more than doubled in volume and in value, and some predict that the state's aquaculture exports could be worth as much as $800 million by 2025. A new report is recommending how that growth should be managed over the next decade. But critics say it's too focused on expanding the industry, and gives short shift to other users of the ocean commons or the ecosystems that they all depend on.  The document sets broad goals for aquaculture's next decade in Maine, starting with streamlined permitting for public water leases that ""balances the rights of the applicant and the public.  And it identifies the potential costs of specific actions: $100,000, for instance, to support a state employee who would help applicants get through the permitting process and engage with host communities, $100,000 to integrate aquaculture into K-12 education, and a quarter million dollars to create a Maine Seafood Council to market both farmed and wild-caught seafood. ""It's one tool that can be used along with the many tools the state has in thinking about the future,"" said Gayle Zydlewski, who directs Maine Sea Grant, a federal-state program housed at the University of Maine that led a collaborative effort to create the so-called Maine Aquaculture Roadmap. ""There is definitely a lot happening in this space. And the roadmap is meant to help the sector strengthen opportunities to connect with local coastal communities. So it really is a time to be thinking about our working waterfront (and) aquaculture and fisheries, recreation and tourism,"" Zydlewski said.  More than 140 stakeholders weighed in, including Chebeague Island oyster farmer Bob Earnest, who sees the plan as a useful guide for growing the industry in a sustainable way. ""We don't want the government managing how many oysters we produce. (They would not be efficient at that.) But we also don't want every retired person like me in the state of Maine selling unsafe product because we're issuing too many licenses and not doing enough education. It's not an easy proposition. This road map speaks to all the right aspects of that evolving industry,"" Earnest said. He added, though, that the sustainability of small, independent farms could be challenged by an emerging influx of venture capital that's backing industrial-scale shellfish farming, and proposed finfish farms on and off the coast. And there are sharper critics. ""The lack of even mentioning any sort of tradeoff of aquaculture in any of these conversations is hugely concerning,"" said Marissa McMahan, a Georgetown-based marine scientist who participated in one of the stakeholder focus groups. She's also one of 19 people who signed a recent letter to Sea Grant criticizing the road for overlooking the value of shared waters for many outside of the aquaculture industry. ""There's no mention of the tradeoffs, and there are potential environmental impacts. There are huge potential social impacts. It's all linked,"" McMahan said. Other critics who signed the letter include lobstermen, the director of Stonington's Maine Center for Coastal Fisheries, several UMaine researchers and Downeast Salmon Federation Director Dwayne Shaw. He said the road map fails to provide a plan for assessing the cumulative impacts of aquaculture leases on ecosystems and wild fisheries, and how aquaculture can hurt efforts to restore them. ""Its not a comprehensive plan but more of a bit of advocacy for economic development utilizing aquaculture. And because aquaculture is so complex with various types of farms being proposed, it's very important that we move cautiously,"" Shaw said. But supporters maintain that fears about unbound growth are unfounded. Brianna Warner is the CEO of Atlantic Sea Farms, the state's biggest seaweed processing company, which provides free seed to 27 independent lobstermen who spend their off-seasons growing and harvesting seaweed. ""We have this thing in Maine which I find very interesting that puts value judgments around 'big is bad and small is good,'"" Warner said. Warner said the state's leasing application process is vigorous and protective of users and the environment. If Maine really wants to create more jobs on the water, she added — good-paying jobs with benefits — some aquaculture operations are going to need to get big enough to achieve the revenue streams that make that possible. ""Look, I think the industry needs to grow responsibly but I don't think there's any indication that it's not,"" she said. The road map authors plan another look at the issues in 2026. And in the meantime Sea Grant director Gayle Zydlewski said she is seeking further conversations with the plan's critics, and a broad multi-sector seafood planning effort, Sea Maine, is getting under way as well.

15,9409,Seaweed isn’t considered enough of a food for more comprehensive FDA safety regulations | Maine Public,"Like any other food, harvested seaweed can have some levels of pathogenic bacteria. But unlike other foods pulled from the ocean, there is little federal guidance on how to reduce food safety risks for seaweed once it’s out of the water. That’s because the long blades of kelp that sea farmers grow off the rocky coast of Maine don’t fall neatly into any single category when it comes to food safety. In fact, in the eyes of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, seaweed isn’t really a food at all. Neither seafood nor vegetable, seaweed is regulated by the FDA as a spice because of its historic use as a dried product eaten in small quantities. But that doesn’t reflect the evolution of seaweed in Maine, where kelp and other species are now commonly used in a plethora of culinary applications, including noodles, salads and kimchi. With this lack of counsel at a higher level, a team of Maine researchers is working to provide local harvesters with new data on how to safely handle seaweed following recent food safety tests on the aquatic plants. For the past two years, scientists at the University of New England have been studying how different storage and drying methods cut down on pathogens. They hope their findings can help develop proper regulations that will protect eaters without overburdening the growing industry. Professors Carrie Byron and Kristin Burkholder, along with graduate student Jessica Vorse, loaded up rockweed and kelp with common pathogens to levels much higher than found naturally. Then they tested the seaweed after air drying, freeze drying and varying storage temperatures. The team found that there was a sharp decline in the pathogens in both drying methods and that colder storage temperatures resulted in less microbiotic activity. While none of that is shocking or unexpected, it gives the FDA and the Maine seaweed industry some hard data to make informed decisions about how to handle seaweed as a food. The lack of tailored regulations hasn’t been an issue with the small number of harvesters and processors in Maine yet. But while there have been no reported cases of illness connected to seaweed in Maine, researchers worry that as the industry grows, the chances of a food safety issue rise, potentially bringing down reactionary regulations that don’t make sense for the aquatic plants. “My concern is this industry is growing super fast,” Byron said. “All it takes is one mistake from one actor to burden the whole industry.” The UNE work is some of the first looking into food safety practices for seaweed. “We’re not doing this work because there is an inherent risk of contamination with seaweed products,” Burkholder said. “Seaweed is safe, and we’re doing this work to keep it safe.” Creating well-fitting and overarching regulations for seaweed will be a long, arduous task. Jennifer Perry, a professor of food microbiology at the University of Maine, has been working with seaweed food safety for years and said there are a number of factors that make it hard to craft comprehensive food safety regulations. There are several different types of seaweed, all of which will likely respond to different pathogens and handling methods in different ways. The Maine industry is also still relatively small compared with other food industries. Here, harvesting methods, growing conditions and air-drying processes are all highly personalized to each farmer, making it hard to replicate in any study. Seaweed in general is also not high on the regulatory priority list for much of the country. But there are concerns that as the industry grows, officials may take the easy route out and just clump seaweed with shellfish regulations. While they both fit under the big umbrella of aquaculture, they interact with their environment in different ways. For instance, seaweed isn’t a filter-feeder like oysters. So waters that are considered contaminated for shellfish, may not be harmful to seaweed. “We really need this data to allow us to make actual data-driven guidelines for the seaweed industry,” Burkholder said. “We wanted to do this because maybe seaweed shouldn’t be treated like shellfish.”",bad,seaweed aquaculture,2022,Maine
16,9411,Portland company with big plans for using seaweed to soak up carbon draws scrutiny | Maine Public,"A Portland startup company that aims to remove millions of tons of planet-warming carbon from the air and store it deep in the ocean is going international. Running Tide is expanding its footprint to Iceland, but its ambitious plans are also drawing scrutiny.  Running Tide founder Marty Odlin has a big idea about how to fight climate change: millions of seaweed farms. Little ones, suspended from biodegradable buoys floating free in the north Atlantic.  He's testing out baseball-size buoys in the company's waterfront headquarters, where they bob around in a wave machine. ""It's a wave pool that accelerates wave action that we would see in the open ocean,"" he says. The wood-fiber buoys are coated with limestone dust that could help the ocean safely absorb more carbon-dioxide. And they'd carry small rafts of seaweed that would grow and photosynthesize, absorbing more carbon. Over time these ""microfarms"" would sink to the deepest ocean floor, to stay there for millennia.  Outside, Odlin points to a jumbo jet flying overhead. ""That's an industry built around releasing carbon into the atmosphere. If we want to bring that carbon back down, we need to operate at that scale,"" he says. Big-name investors have committed to buying carbon-dioxide removal credits from the company, whose value one venture-capital tracker pegs at $14 million. Its plans have received positive attention from CNN and The Atlantic. But an article published last month in the MIT Technology Review was more critical. Some scientists are also skeptical.  ""We've never tried to have an invasion of near-shore marine life into the open ocean. So we need to think carefully about this,"" says Philip Boyd, a professor of Marine Biogeochemistry at the University of Tasmania.  Boyd and other scientists say that while each microfarm Running Tide floats might be small, an enormous number would be required to make a real dent in climate change — with complex and potentially harmful effects on ocean ecosystems. Boyd questions whether the seaweed rafts might compete with open-ocean plankton for nutrients, introduce harmful microbes or filter the light available for deep-sea life. ""And you know, our conclusions are not saying 'don't do it'; our conclusions are saying, 'this looks like it's more complex than you're probably currently envisaging.' So you need to be extra diligent,'"" says Boyd. CEO Marty Odlin says his staff of more than 60 is determined to get it right, gradually deploying larger and larger sets of rafts — responding to the data and analyses with each iteration. They're also working with a panel of outside scientific advisers from a research collective called ""Ocean Visions."" Those include Jim Barry, a deep-sea ecologist at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute. ""You know, they're trying to do something that's difficult, in general,"" Barry says. Barry says Running Tide has been responsive to the group's concerns about upending ocean ecosystems. With novel carbon-removal companies springing up around the world, he says there are tough choices ahead over how to balance environmental degradation against the threat of global warming. ""I think we need to think about these things and Running Tide is doing that. Maybe I'm not sure if their approach is the best one but at least they're moving ahead with it,"" Barry says. And even sympathetic observers like Barry worry that the financing needed to design and deploy the new technologies could become a distraction.  ""The carbon market for this is going to happen. I worry that groups like Running Tide might be, in a sense, chained to their funding source and they're conflicted because they want to do the right thing but at the same time they're trying to make money off of it. There's some difficult choices there,"" Barry says.    Nan Ransohoff is Head of Climate at Stripe, a software company which so far has committed a half million dollars to Running Tide. She's also the leader of a $925 million carbon-removal initiative funded by her company and other dot-com heavyweights. ""There are open questions for Running Tide and for most of the other companies that we are funding, and that is what we expect,"" she says. ""I think we should expect rapid iteration, especially for companies that are in their infancy... We're pretty risk-tolerant at the beginning when there's small scale."" She says Stripe will buy another half million dollars worth of Running Tide credits only if it can produce data on ecosystem effects and verifiable CO2 removal. Odlin says Running Tide has already engineered unique data recorders that will provide the real-world information on ecosystem effects and carbon removal that scientists and funders alike want to see. ""We were the first people to grow kelp in the open ocean and measure it. It was a tremendous amount of computing power to put into something so small and operating remote thousands of miles from shore,"" Odlin says. The Icelandic government likes what it's seeing so far.

17,9415,Waterfront property among focal points of latest preservation efforts by Land for Maine's Future | Maine Public,"The Land for Maine's Future Board this week approved funding for 12 new projects that will preserve working farmland, waterfront, and forests across Maine and also protect public access to those lands.  Dave Dickison of Sea Meadow Marine Foundation says the foundation's project will ensure that the ""Even Keel Boatyard"" in Yarmouth continues to serve working families who make their living on the sea. ""This is one of the last working waterfronts between Portland and Harpswell, that is waterfront that is purely working,"" Dickison said. ""It's an important piece of property for aquaculture folks to have access to their farms on the water."" Dickison says the aquaculture industry is booming, and new jobs are likely as markets for oysters, kelp and other ocean products grow. Of the 12 projects announced, three will preserve working farmland, four will preserve working waterfronts, and five will preserve working forests.",neutral,seaweed aquaculture,2022,Maine
19,9438,Researchers seek statewide changes to save clam fishery from climate-driven collapse   | Castine Patriot | Penobscot Bay Press ,"The Harraseeket River recedes slowly but steadily around Chad Coffin’s metal skiff, until the boat is beached on a partly exposed mudflat. Coffin and his daughter, Bailey Pennell, are already out of the skiff, rakes in hand and rubber boots sinking deep into the gray-brown muck.  They begin to dig—but not for soft-shell clams, also known as steamers, belly clams or Ipswich clams, a prized Maine commodity that Coffin has harvested here in Freeport for decades. Instead, he and Pennell are scrounging for quahogs, or hard clams. They fetch a lower price, but the part of these flats where any soft-shells might be found is closed to harvest after a recent rain.  “This used to be all clams when I started clamming,” Coffin said. “I would have been able to dig right there, where the mud’s showing already. And now we can’t. There’s nothing there.”  This is becoming a typical struggle for some Maine clammers. Though the soft-shell fishery is typically Maine’s second-most valuable after lobster, statewide landings for the clams are near all-time lows—down from close to 40 million pounds a year in the 1970s to fewer than 10 million pounds a year for most of the past decade.  Coffin and some researchers are confident they know the main reason: green crabs. This invasive species eats clams voraciously, and warming waters are causing the crabs’ population to explode.  “Climate change is just that piece of dynamite that’s been thrown into that room,” said Brian Beal, a professor of ecology and longtime clam researcher with the University of Maine at Machias. “That has just changed everything.”  Beal and Coffin are among the clammers, scientists and other observers who believe the problems facing the fishery are clear. But the solutions they’re calling for have been slow to gain traction at the state level.  Warming waters drive crabs’ numbers Coffin turns over chunks of mud on the flats in Freeport with his hand rake, periodically pulling out a quahog and tossing it in a plastic bucket. Almost immediately he also finds something else—a small green crab, sluggish with cold but alive. He tosses it into the skiff. Left out of the water long enough it will die—one down, but many thousands to go.  Coffin and others acknowledge that trying to eradicate green crabs is futile. Gabriela Bradt, a fisheries specialist with the University of New Hampshire Sea Grant who focuses in part on green crabs, blames the decline of very cold winters. Sustained, freezing weather can kill green crabs in intertidal areas, helping to keep the population in check.  “Up until about 15, 20 years ago, we were still getting really long cold winters, you know—like below-zero temperatures for extended days and things like that—and we just don’t get them anymore,” Bradt said. “Now we’ve had extended periods of warm winters, and they’re not being eradicated that way. And so that means they’re eating more, they’re reproducing more for longer periods of time, and their numbers are just out of control.” Bradt wants to see commercial-scale harvesting of green crabs, which were introduced to North America on ships from Europe in the 1800s—but acknowledges this “eat the invasives” effort may be slow to grow and would only “bring them down to hopefully a dull roar.”  Meanwhile, the average winter low temperature in coastal Maine has risen from single digits in the early 1900s to the low 20s in recent years, according to the state climatologist’s office.  This kind of increase is a boon to green crabs. In the 1950s, the Gulf of Maine saw a short, seemingly random spike in temperatures—and with it, a proliferation in green crabs that decimated the clam sector, according to a key 1955 study, which Beal shared.  “We should have known what was going to happen because it had already happened before,” Beal said. “It’s just no one paid attention.”  Losing the next generation Sara Randall, the associate director of the Downeast Institute, has worked with Beal on myriad studies about soft-shell clams and green crabs—including more than 30 experiments in Freeport alone between 2013 and 2018.  “We found that over 99% of the clams that are settling out of the water column (into a mudflat) are dying before they reach 1 year old,” Randall said. “The 1-year-old part is important because that means they’re not reaching harvestable size.”  It can take at least two years for these vanishingly tiny juvenile clams to grow into adults and reach the minimum harvestable size of 2 inches across. Smaller clams don’t bury themselves as deep into the mudflats, leaving themselves especially vulnerable to predators like crabs.  “Clams start growing and become food,” Coffin said. “That’s what I learned with (Beals’) research—everything is happening before we get a chance to see it.” The larger clams left for harvest now are mostly concentrated closer to land. This part of the intertidal can be harder for clammers to access, and tends to close to harvest after heavy rains—which are also expected to increase with climate change. Research suggests that the older clams that can be harvested are not being replaced with a new generation, which could lead to the fishery’s demise.  So some, like Coffin, are proposing a big shift in tactics: Catch the clams while they’re babies. “We need to change the way that we fish for bivalves in Maine,” Coffin said. “We need to fish for them when they’re in the larval stage because if we don’t, they won’t be there. We have to fish for them when there’s 30 of them on the head of a pin…and then protect them until they’re a size that is commercially valuable.”  Research on the best ways to do this is ongoing, but Beal said it likely would involve nets or boxes built into the mud where clams could grow safely, relatively protected from green crabs.  In some ways this approach and its complications resemble aquaculture—the kind that’s on the rise in Maine for oysters, mussels and kelp. But people like Randall shy away from this term, worried it can carry a stigma for clammers who pride themselves on a “wild” catch.  “This is not, like, aquaculture for aquaculture’s sake. It is adapting to the changed ecological circumstances that we’re in, which is driven by the warming water,” Randall said. “I call it active management or adaptive management …It’s all about the question of, how are we going to be able to continue to have this fishery'”  These approaches also come with many new challenges for clammers. There’s currently no permit to allow the taking of larval clams, though something similar does exist in the scallop fishery. Clammers could also need leases—and face conflicts with neighbors—to build in the mudflats. Ownership rights in the intertidal are the subject of an ongoing court fight.  Turning point for a graying fleet Many of the biggest clamming towns are Downeast, in rural communities where fishing is a linchpin of local economies. Some towns farther south—such as Freeport and Brunswick—also rank high for clam landings because of their expansive mudflats. An influx of new coastal property owners in these areas has led to new tensions over access to the clam flats.  Clammers also face more universal sustainability concerns. As in many fisheries, the fleet is getting older and faces health problems from the grueling physical nature of their work. Pennell, Coffin’s 23-year-old daughter, has decided to work in oyster aquaculture instead of clamming. “They’re easier for me to get, and I like doing oysters more because it’s more entertaining, I think,” she said as she chucked quahogs into an orange bin on the mud. “Easier on your body.” “They’re on top of the mud,” Coffin added. And, he said, harder—though not impossible—for green crabs to eat. Caitlin Gerber, a conservation steward with the Maine Coast Heritage Trust and co-owner of Chebeague Island Oyster Company, said she’s seen larger green crabs tear open a plastic bag of oyster seeds—but overall the dead-loss is more manageable than for clams. To her, the biggest trade-off with an aquaculture approach is cost. Traditional clamming requires little of the investment of, say, buying a lobster boat or starting an oyster farm. But she said more of that so-called “active management” may be the best option as waters continue to warm. “I think if you want a future living off of the marine world, it’s something to consider…I love having any opportunity to work on the water, be in touch with what’s going on under the surface, and aquaculture allows me to do that,” Gerber said. “But I would understand anyone that would say, ‘Ah, I just want to do it the way I’ve been doing it until I can’t anymore.’” Debate over size limits Small studies and experimental programs at the local level have popped up across the state to try and revive clam harvests with aquacultural tools.  The nonprofit Manomet Institute has put out guidance on clam farming, and looked for ways to grow the quahog fishery. In Gouldsboro, volunteers are trying to raise Downeast Institute-grown soft-shell clams in protective trays, though infiltrating green crabs have eaten into their success.  But Coffin and others argue that local or voluntary changes aren’t enough, and statewide reforms will be necessary to make clamming commercially sustainable.  Besides new permitting schemes for raising clams from wild-caught larvae, changes could include size limit changes to allow harvest of smaller adults while making larger clams off-limits so they can keep breeding and replenishing the dwindling population.  Right now, clams must be at least 2 inches across to be harvestable, with no required upper size limit. In 2017, the state legislature’s Marine Resources Committee killed a bill to lower the minimum to 1.5 inches and set a new maximum. The state Department of Marine Resources testified against the proposal, citing industry concerns about the marketability of smaller clams.  Coffin and DMR officials have come into bitter conflict over issues like this. While digging for quahogs in Freeport, he called DMR “pathetic” and said its scientific approach was based on “myth.”  “I think if you’re going to manage an animal or a biological resource, that you have to at least apply some of the biology of that animal,” Coffin said. “It can’t just be all about what a market wants or what, you know, a fisherman wants to do.”  Solutions at scale Melissa White, the newly appointed head of DMR’s recently renamed Nearshore Marine Resources Program, declined a phone interview but responded to questions by email.  “The Nearshore Marine Resource Program will be investigating issues affecting Maine’s softshell clam populations including predation, warming ocean waters and climate change,” she said. “Through these investigations, we intend to identify the biggest threats and help municipalities develop plans to address them.”  White said the investigations will include monitoring “sentinel sites” where they can study clam recruitment—the fishery term for baby clams joining the harvestable population.  Much of the planned state research will be similar to studies Beal and others have completed in recent years, which he said frustrates him.  White also said DMR would “be happy to engage industry in any conversation about potential data-driven changes to size limits,” and noted that external research is in the works.  It could include a “fecundity study” that Beal and Randall will undertake in the next two years. Its goal is to pinpoint what makes clams most successful at reproducing—factors like time of year, tidal height, the clams’ size and geographic location.  Beal said adjusting DMR’s size limits for clams on a pilot basis, with a five-year sunset clause, would make sense and could function as useful research by itself.  “If we’re actually seeing more clams settling and surviving, well, then, that’s the way to do it,” he said. “We know we can’t keep green crabs at bay—because we’ve put all the nets out, because there’s just not enough time, and people and money to do that. You can do it on the scale of an acre or two, but you can’t do it on the scale of the state of Maine.”  On their tiny patch of Freeport’s 1,200 acres of intertidal area, Chad Coffin and his daughter are caked in mud and bagging up a modest haul of quahogs as the tide begins to rise again. It’s already been another rough season for soft-shells. Coffin fears next year will be even worse.  “This is an incredible amount of resources available, as far as the mudflats go,” Coffin said. “It’s just there isn’t much in them anymore.” This story was originally published by The Maine Monitor, a nonprofit and nonpartisan news organization.",good,seaweed aquaculture,2023,Maine
20,9463,View from the Porch - Issue 132 | Maine Boats Homes & Harbors," Codforsaken gulf, kelp beer, and an eye on the tides and wind 
As I write this in early September, it’s fair season, and there’s a full month of these wonderful annual expositions ahead. I hope you managed a visit to one or two. I have a particular affection for the Farmington Fair in mid-September, an event so epic and important in Franklin County that we used to get a day off from school to attend. In the 1950s, announcements would pop up in store windows and on telephone poles. Now fairs have web sites as well. This fall was the 174th Farmington Fair, organized by the Franklin County Agricultural Society. For the town kids, this was often our closest look at livestock, although in a small town surrounded by family farms, it was a rare kid in Wilton who hadn’t spent time with a classmate on a nearby farm. My uncle operated a dairy farm not far from Wilton, and we often spent time with our cousins there, so the smell of manure around the fair was not unfamiliar. There were rides, a midway with shooting galleries and games of chance, and horse racing, which as a kid I didn’t find particularly compelling. My favorite tent was the one where the local car dealers would show off the next year’s models and the area where you could climb around on the tractors.  Kelp! Kelp! I’m drinking Marshall Wharf Brewing Company of Belfast is a small brewery that is not afraid to try new ingredients, such as oysters and hot peppers. When word got out that they were brewing a Scotch Ale with some Maine sugar kelp added, the news went viral, attracting among others, National Public Radio, from which I gleaned the details. It seems that the owner of Marshall Wharf Brewing, David Carlson, got quite excited about a beer from Scotland called Kelpie. He reached out to Sarah Redmond of the UMaine Center for Cooperative Aquaculture Research for help. Ms. Redmond is something of a kelp evangelist and hooked Mr. Carlson up with Peter Arnold of Maine Fresh Sea Farms. It all came together this summer with the first batch of Sea Belt, a peat-smoked, malt-based Scotch ale with 6 pounds of dried sugar kelp per 200-gallon batch. Ten pounds of fresh kelp equals 1 pound of dry. For you home brewers, sugar kelp is a variety widely used in food worldwide. Don’t think you can go buy a can of Blue Ribbon malt extract and pitch in a few handfuls of whatever is drifting by your skiff. I am dispatching my beer patrol to Belfast for a taste test soon. On their beer menu at marshallwharf.com you’ll find some other offbeat entries as well, such as Cant Dog IPA and Chaos Chaos stout. I wonder if there are any motels in walking distance. Codforsaken Gulf of Maine - In one of Bill Trotter’s blogs on the Bangor Daily News web site, we learned that last year was grim for the Gulf of Maine cod population. Mr. Trotter deserves credit for my title since his was “Cod Forsaking the Gulf of Maine.” Cod were what initially drove Europeans to New England; Portuguese cod fishermen were on Damariscove Island years before the Pilgrims. Now the Northeast Fisheries Science Center reports that the fish biomass actually declined in 2013 despite strict fisheries management rules designed to rebuild the stocks. If the science holds up, more restrictions loom on the horizon. That, coupled with last year’s suspension of shrimp fishing, means the news is just getting worse for Maine fishermen. Man cannot live by (or on) lobster alone. Speaking of lobster, as of the end of August, some dealers were reporting landings to date about 20 percent lower than 2012, the year of the early season shedder glut. Some dealers were even predicting a smaller than average season this year. The price, however, has held up thanks to improving demand in a healthier economy. Bass Harbor Riches - Our avid reader may remember a short article in 2011 noting the launch of one of the prettiest little lobsteryachts we had ever seen, the 28-foot Andromeda. Built by Chummy Rich to a design by his father, Andromeda had that “just right” look, and traditional oak, cedar, and bronze construction. The lead man on the project was Rich Helmke, himself an owner of a 1959 version of the same boat. He had joined Chummy at Bass Harbor Boat after bringing his own boat there for some work.
Chummy Rich sold the shop to Helmke this last spring, a deal that had reportedly been percolating for years. Rich plans to continue working at the yard. Congratulations to Helmke; we look forward to seeing the work of this yard for years to come. And in nearby Southwest Harbor, the Hinckley Company is hard at work on their new sailboat, the Bermuda 50, designed by Bill Tripp, III, the son of Bermuda 40 designer, Bill Tripp, Jr. It is a thoroughly modern performance cruiser that will undoubtedly see some time on a race course, while providing a splendid platform for sailing fast in comfort and style. Or, as a close friend of mine called it (after adding a few creature comforts to his Tripp 41 raceboat), “cruising with an attitude.” Happy landing - The Landing School in Arundel named a new president, Richard Schuman, who not only has a Ph.D. in engineering, but also graduated from the Landing School itself almost 30 years ago. He’ll also serve on the faculty as a professor of Engineering Design. His resume is staggering and includes impressive stints as a scholar, teacher, and administrator. Quite a catch.
The Landing School has filled a niche in Maine higher learning by providing a hands-on education for those who want to find a career in the marine world, whether boatbuilding, yacht design, or marine systems. They have had great success in placing their graduates in the industry. With the appointment of Dr. Schuman, the school promises to continue that success and growth. - Check out landingschool.edu. Your next boat may be rambling around in one of those young brains right now. If you love boats and Maine, think about supporting the school. One way to do it is to buy one of their boats. Other mind-altering news - In 2013 Portland voters supported a petition to legalize recreational marijuana. This election season has several other cities following suit. I read in the Bangor Daily News that the Lewiston City Council decided to send the question to the voters in November. The Lewiston petition was written to allow the City Council to legalize pot on its own or send it to the voters, which probably explains why the vote was unanimous to do the latter. South Portland and York will also get a shot at similar petitions. I have always thought that the Portland vote was kind of silly; a municipality can’t expressly authorize the use of a substance that is illegal on state and federal levels. Probably the rationale is to express a sentiment for publicity purposes, like when the US House voted a thousand or so times to repeal the Affordable Care Act. That was certainly effective in drawing a lot of attention to the House Republicans, though perhaps not the kind they were looking for. Maybe we can somehow combine casinos and pot into one giant statewide referendum. We could have special economic zones where you could service all of your addictions in one place, surrounded by fields of weed and distilleries. Eyes on the tides - A company named Halcyon Tidal Power is running into some stiff local opposition to its proposal to dam a cove in Pembroke for a tidal power facility. We have noted the successful tests of submerged turbines in the area, home to some of this country’s most powerful tides. This project is vastly different in that it blockades a cove and will require a lock for navigation of fishing boats up to 42 feet. The Quoddy Tides reported on the meeting, which is one of three community meetings required by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. In a time when we applaud the removal of dams to re-establish historical fish runs, damming an estuary when there seems to be a less invasive way of harnessing this natural power source doesn’t make a lot of sense. Admittedly I am clueless as to the comparative cost-effectiveness of the two approaches. Conceptually I fall on the side of free flowing rivers, although this isn’t exactly a river. As you can see I am somewhat conflicted. However, if I lived on that cove and my living depended on getting in and out of it in a boat, I’d probably get a little wound up at the prospect of a dam. Chips ahoy - Staying in the “Far East,” August saw the first shipment of wood chips from Eastport to Ireland for biomass-fueled energy production. The Bangor Daily News article by Jacqueline Weaver did not specify what technology on the other end will utilize the product, whether it will be burned for heat directly or used to produce electricity. At any rate the bulk handling system and storage yard in the Port of Eastport made the arrangement possible. The chips have to be dried and later sanitized aboard ship to meet European Union requirements. The heating is to kill the pinewood nematode, a microscopic pest that kills trees. The chips use wood harvest byproducts unsuitable for higher value uses such as paper pulp. When the BDN article was written in early August, the biggest obstacle seemed to be finding the labor to harvest the wood waste. Here again, the University of Maine played a key role in developing the processes to sanitize the product for shipment, called phytosanitization. Aside from our interest in promoting the export of Maine products, it is really fun to use words like phytosanitization and nematode. Wind in the waves  In one last plug for the University of Maine and its various technology centers, early September marked the first anniversary of the scaled wind turbine project developed by the University’s Advanced Structures and Composites Center. This project demonstrated the feasibility of a floating turbine attached directly to the power grid. The center’s chief, Habib Dagher, called the year-long test a complete success and will now turn his attention to a full-scale version with 450' blades. Maine Maritime Academy provided a vessel to ferry an assemblage of politicians, U.S. Department of Energy, and university representatives to the test site to applaud the project and garner some press for it, which you may remember from a previous column was partially funded at the junior varsity level by the DOE. The pace and success of this project might move it up the roster. Let’s hope so. My only question is how many cormorants can perch on it when the blades aren’t moving' There is nothing like fall for a hike in Maine, whether up Morse Mountain in Phippsburg, the peaks of Acadia, or the mountains of Franklin County.

Arriving unannounced on a Saturday morning, we only took a peek at kelp drying in a greenhouse. A few days later, I spoke on the phone with Redmond. She told me about her nutrient-rich culinary seasonings, explaining that “People aren’t familiar with what to do with seaweed, so we make it easy for them.” I learned that Redmond is a bellwether in the state’s seaweed farming efforts, actively sharing her experience. “There’s so much potential for us to produce seaweed here,” she declared. It’s a winter crop, she noted, grown when other ocean-related businesses are quiet, and yields a harvest in the first season. The varieties she grows include alaria, dulse, and sugar and skinny kelp.

23,9505,Wells Reserve | Maine Boats Homes & Harbors,"On peaceful walks in the Wells Reserve, where trails lead from a restored 19th-century saltwater farm to gentle meadows and the shore, I’ve photographed textured landscapes of salt marsh and upland fields, and spied on piping plovers enjoying the sand beach. I’ve inhaled sweet and pungent scents. My mind has wandered freely, unhurried, the quiet broken only by the brush of wind, bird song, and rolling waves. That was before I discovered that the Wells National Estuarine Research Reserve has a busy double life. Located half way between Portland and Portsmouth, the town of Wells is home to the only National Estuarine Research Reserve in Maine. Its 2,250 acres include seven miles of interpretive trails that are open to the public year-round. But this seemingly tranquil sanctuary is also an active hub for learning. Visiting scientists join staff researchers at the Maine Coastal Ecology Center to study biodiversity, coastal ecology, and climate change in watersheds throughout southern Maine. Educators and volunteers annually conduct more than 100 classes for people of all ages. Community leaders meet here to plan for weather-related emergencies and collaborate to conserve natural resources. Annual craft and music festivals and frequent guided bird walks attract people from afar. And here, too, history is preserved, because an historic farm, Laudholm, is now the site of today’s reserve. When people think of marine biology  in Maine, they generally think of whales,  cod, haddock, and other commercial fisheries. Yet estuaries such as the one above are hugely important to how those offshore systems function. First settled for farming in 1643, the property was worked continuously by successive owners for more than 300 years. Soon after being named Laudholm Farms in 1908, it grew to be the largest saltwater farm in York County. It supplied milk, cream, butter, eggs, and broilers to the Wells community and sent products weekly to Boston. But the farming operation gradually declined and some buildings fell into disuse. In 1978, local citizens formed a trust to save the historic property on which developers were planning to build single-family homes. By then, most of the farm buildings were structurally sound but neglected, the silo was beyond repair, and the water tower had no tank. After several years of fund-raising, the group had enough money to purchase the land. Then came news that the Maine State Planning Office had received word from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) that the National Estuarine Sanctuary system was looking for a site in Maine. The town of Wells expressed interest and joined forces with the Laudholm preservationists. The save-the-farm focus shifted to a wider purpose with multiple partners. Now on the National Register of Historic Places, Laudholm is no longer a working farm. Estuaries are where rivers meet the sea, mixing fresh water with salt. These amazingly productive ecosystems provide habitat for an absorbing array of plant and animal life, they filter pollutants from water before it reaches the sea, and they act as buffers against coastal storms. Of the 28 National Estuarine Research Reserves in the United States, from Alaska to the Great Lakes and Puerto Rico, all are partnerships between the federal government and coastal states. The Wells Reserve is overseen by a state entity (Wells Reserve Management Authority) and funded largely by NOAA (federal) and the private, nonprofit, “state” partner, Laudholm Trust. This public-private funding relationship is unique within the reserve system. The trust and NOAA account for most of its budget. Additional major partners are the Town of Wells; the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry; and the USFWS Rachel Carson National Wildlife Refuge. Several universities and smaller entities participate to a lesser extent. Curious to learn more about what happens off the trails, I arranged to meet some of the folks in charge at the Wells Reserve. In the Maine Coastal Ecology Center (a part of the reserve), Research Associate Jeremy Miller and his colleagues focus on how changes in adjacent land use, as well as in such physical and environmental variables as climate change and sea level rise, affect the ecology and function of estuaries. Despite the importance of estuaries as coastal buffers and the natural beauty that they hold, Miller said, they are an understudied part of our natural world. When people think of marine biology in Maine, they generally think of whales, cod, haddock, and other commercial fisheries, yet estuaries are hugely important to how those offshore systems function. Estuaries act as filters, habitats, nurseries, and feeding grounds for many species of commercial importance. Miller manages the System Wide Monitoring Program, a core element of the Wells Reserve’s effort to collect data on water quality, weather, and nutrients. The data contributes to a nationwide monitoring system maintained by all 28 estuarine reserves. “We have a lot of visiting researchers who come with many different outlooks, some studying plants or fish or mammals,” Miller said. “This long-term monitoring data gives them a good background for comparing change. Someone studying fish in the river, for example, can get water quality information going back to 1995. They’re just blown away by the fact that we have monitoring data going back that far. The data can sometimes help to explain what they’re seeing in the estuary. It lays a good groundwork of environmental data they can reference or learn from.” Among other tasks, Miller and his associates monitor larval fish. In this early life stage, when the fish hatch from their eggs and are actually part of the plankton, moving with the tides, they become food for other species as they transition into the juvenile stage. “We found cod and three species of flounder in our estuary, and a lot of migratory fish, like herring, that are bait fish in the marsh,” Miller said. “Nutrients we see in the water often drive the biological component. Fish can’t live where the water isn’t suitable for them because of low oxygen or particles suspended in the water.” Miller also coordinates local volunteers for MIMIC, the Marine Invader Monitoring and Information Collaborative, run and funded by the Coastal Zone Management Program in Boston, keeping tabs on marine invasive species in the Gulf of Maine. Once a month, the Wells MIMIC team monitors docks, tidal pools, and intertidal habitats from York Harbor to South Portland. Invasive species, introduced by ballast-water discharge from ships traveling from international ports, the fouled hulls of recreational boats, and, to a lesser extent, the release of exotic pet fish and crabs, compete with native species and sometimes foul commercial fishing gear. “Invasive species are wreaking havoc on a lot of fisheries, particularly aquaculture,” said Miller. “My best example is the mussels farmed on Prince Edward Island, all of which are farmed on big ropes. Invasives are settling onto those same ropes, adding too much weight, and the ropes are snapping.” Research loses its relevance if it’s not shared. Wells Reserve Director Paul Dest oversees a year-round staff of 14 that doubles in number when interns, post-doctoral fellows, and graduate students arrive in the warm months. Dest said their diverse activities are community focused and that partnerships are a hallmark of the Wells Reserve. He singled out the reserve’s Coastal Training Program as an example of community orientation. The Coastal Training Program is led by educator Dr. Christine Feurt, who said the program puts science into the hands and minds of decision-makers, including state officials, harbormasters, clam wardens, and local planning boards. The goal is to get everyone to think cumulatively rather than narrowly about impact on their own area of responsibility. Among hot-button issues addressed in CTP workshops is shoreline zoning. “Even though people are bound to enforce the Clean Water Protection Act,” Feurt said, “they often don’t see what they’re doing that way. If the shoreline buffer is left alone, it has the ability to filter out pollution at no cost, but if we’re talking about your house, you may just want the view.” A series of boat trips, called “We’re All in the Same Boat,” is proving to be an effective tool to open the eyes of community leaders. The excursions are part of a five-year project with the University of New Hampshire. Groups venture out on the Saco or Salmon Falls rivers with Jeremy Miller at the helm. Dialogue is redirected as participants literally look at the estuary shoreline differently from the way they view it from land. “Wells Reserve is surrounded by experts,” Feurt said, “so we create a space to talk about the issues people are wrestling with.” In addition to clean-water protection and storm-water management, the conversation includes such subjects as woodlot management and chemical-free lawns that limit runoff’s affect on the environment for lobsters, among other inhabitants. Of the more than 400 bird species known to come to Maine, 122 visit the Saco River estuary. The marsh is also a nursery for some 20 species of fish. Reserve director Paul Dest said the general public has become more aware of the watershed’s importance as global warming puts greater demands on shoreline areas. The reserve’s research program was founded by Dr. Michele Dionne, who directed the effort for 21 years until her death in 2012. Her signature programs focus on two main waterways: the Little River Estuary, which forms a northern/eastern boundary for the reserve, and the Webhannet River, protected in part by the Rachel Carson NWR but also close to heavily developed tourist areas. Research scientist Jennifer Dijkstra, who worked alongside Dionne, is advancing what is known about how algae in a salt marsh determine the presence of other plants and animals. Among her experiments has been a series to determine how animals that inhabit the salt marsh use various forms of seaweed habitat for food, shelter from predators and protection from the sun. There are real-world implications for the work. Seaweed (a free-living form of algae) is a harvestable crop used for fertilizer, packing, animal feed and cosmetics. One variety is rockweed, which can be harvested mechanically at a rate of 100,000 pounds per day. In 2010, Maine’s rockweed harvest was 12.7 million pounds. If excessive quantities are improperly removed, the impact can be detrimental to organisms at the salt marsh surface, significantly altering the ecosystem. The marsh is also home to some 20 species of fish. Meanwhile, restoration projects are under way. In the Drakes Island Marsh, a culvert originally allowed tidal waters to flow under Drakes Island Road, keeping salt marsh on both sides relatively healthy. When the culvert collapsed, fresh water dominated the upstream portion of the salt marsh, causing a decline in the marsh’s quality and overall size. Now a new culvert allows the tide to flow properly, improving habitat and helping manage water levels to prevent basement flooding in nearby homes. Stewardship programs at the reserve also protect and manage habitats and wildlife. There are projects to improve shrubland habitat for cottontails, Maine’s only native rabbit, and thin the local deer population, which is estimated at more than 75 per square mile. Because deer are voracious eaters of native plants and act as hosts for Lyme-disease-carrying ticks during the second year of the tick life cycle, they are of growing concern here and elsewhere. Nearly 8,000 people of all ages participated in nature programs and workshops at the Wells Reserve during 2011, said Education Director Suzanne Kahn Eder. In addition to bird walks guided by York County Audubon volunteers, there’s a climate-change speaker series that includes discussions of inexpensive ways to be more environmentally responsible. Estuary kayak trips with a Maine Guide are offered from late spring until fall. Year-round, free exhibits and guided tours delve into the history of the saltwater farm, explore biodiversity of the intertidal zone, look for evidence of animal homes, and reveal what’s special about the salt marsh. Discovery Program backpacks, for children ages 6 to 12, are available for loan. They contain field guides, binoculars, bird identifiers with sound cards, and games to play out on the trails. A new school program, Wild Friends in Wild Places, for school children in grades K-2, in partnership with York’s Center for Wildlife, introduces children to bird and mammal “ambassadors,” whose injuries prevent them from living in the wild; the children are taken out in the field to look for the habitats that wounded kestrels, owls, spotted turtles, bats, and opossums prefer. A clever Picture Post Project encourages visitors on the trails to hold the back of their digital cameras against each side of an octagonal post, shoot each scene, create a panoramic photo, and upload the photo to a designated website. It’s part of Digital Earth Watch, a collaboration among the University of Southern Maine, the University of New Hampshire, and other partners. The cumulative album chronicles shifting sands and tides at Laudholm Beach, habitat for cottontail rabbits, and seasonal transformation of shrubland and salt marsh. And then there are the Geographic Information System (GIS) maps, materials, and training services developed at the reserve. The maps and materials are primarily for use by land trusts and conservation commissions; the training is most often offered to municipal officials, storm-water professionals, and others in related fields. Yes, the Wells Reserve is a busy place, though most of the work there takes place discretely in the background. I felt better about not long ago being ignorant of the reserve’s double life when I met Nik Charov, president of the Laudholm Trust. He said he had no idea the place even existed despite having driven past it while traveling between Peaks Island and New York every summer for 35 years. That changed when he and his wife decided to move their family to Portland. Charov, an avid outdoorsman, sees his new position as president of the Laudholm Trust as the perfect job. After eight years in New York City working to protect the environment and develop science programs as a fundraiser for both Bette Midler’s New York Restoration Project and the New York Hall of Science, he said the Wells Reserve has captivated him because it engages people with nature through education, art, data, and stewardship. “It’s off the beaten path and people love how pristine this place is,” said Charov, sitting in his art-filled office. “But there are weddings here almost every weekend all summer and festivals like the annual Laudholm Nature Crafts Festival in September. It’s a great, safe place for kids to run on a clean, protected beach.” As president of the reserve’s fundraising arm, Charov’s vision is already taking shape. This August, a string quartet will perform at sunset in the barn. In the audience, a birder on his first visit to the reserve might discover that there are guided walks during the fall migration season. In September, at the annual Crafts Festival, a family may decide to return in winter to hike the trails. And on a misty spring morning, a scientist or a writer might wander, as this writer did, immersed in nature’s magic and mysteries.",neutral,seaweed aquaculture,2020,Maine
24,9516,On the Town Dock — Issue 150 | Maine Boats Homes & Harbors,"Getting to school in rural Maine can be a challenge. We’ve all heard stories about long bus rides, but what about boat rides' Five students, ages 5 to 13, who live on Islesford, rowed to school on Great Cranberry Island and back most days last fall, according to an article in the Ellsworth American. Rowing with them and making sure they were safe was Tony Archino, who teaches boatbuilding with Islesford Boatworks. He came up with the idea. On days when the weather was good, some or all of the Islesford students rowed the half mile or so over to Great Cranberry and Longfellow School in the morning and back home in the afternoon. It takes about half an hour to row from one island to the other. Sometimes, Longfellow Principal Lindsay Eysnogle, who also lives on Islesford, rowed with the students. They took the mailboat when winds or rain made the crossing too rough. Their boat was a 22-foot St. Ayles skiff. Support for edible “weed” research. No, not that kind—seaweed. Several recent grants to Maine organizations are intended to promote edible seaweed production in Maine. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration awarded $908,015 to the University of Maine for research into sustainable post-harvest processing (such as drying, blanching, and freezing) of aquacultured seaweed and development of value-added products. The goal is to increase the capacity of Maine seaweed producers and processors. Meanwhile, the University of New England landed a U.S. Department of Energy grant for $1.32 million to develop a three-dimensional modeling tool to simulate hydrodynamic-induced mechanical stresses that seaweed farms face in the open ocean. That data could then be used to determine the structural performance of new and existing farm designs in the Gulf of Maine. A day with yacht designers Lyman-Morse Boatbuilding and the Cruising Club of America hosted a Yacht Designers Forum at the yard in Thomaston last October. The morning session was held on the third floor mezzanine of their boatshop. Nine of today’s best yacht designers exhibited small displays of their current work to share their knowledge with those of us who love boats, profess to know something about boats, and who quickly realized that these guys really know about boats. It was heady stuff. The Forum later moved to the Farnsworth Art Museum’s Wyeth Center for two sold-out panel discussions looking at the challenges facing the sport of boats, and the advances in the various aspects of design, ranging from propulsion, which is going through an incredible evolutionary spurt, through onboard systems, and the future of foiling. Participating yacht designers included: Peter Boyce of C. Raymond Hunt; Scott Jutson of Jutson Marine Design; David McCollough of McCollough Yachts; Ed Joy of Ed Joy Yacht Design; Chuck Paine of CW Paine Yacht Design; Jay Paris of Jay E. Paris Naval Architecture; Bob Stephens of Stephens Waring Yacht Design; Jim Taylor of Jim Taylor Yacht Designs; Paul Waring of Stephens Waring Yacht Design; and Doug Zurn of Zurn Yacht Design.

For the first time in 25 years of monitoring no wild Atlantic salmon returned from the sea this year to the Magaguadavic River fishway in New Brunswick, Canada, according to a report in the Quoddy Tides. This led to renewed charges by a wild salmon conservation organization about the impact of farmed salmon escapees on wild salmon runs. However, an area fish farming association defended the industry’s practices and called for a new approach to help the wild salmon population recover, according to the newspaper’s report. In 1983 the Department of Fisheries and Oceans estimated that 900 wild salmon entered the Magaguadavic River to spawn. But despite a multi-year cooperative stocking program, the number of wild salmon in the river continued to drop. The Atlantic Salmon Federation says the loss of wild Magaguadavic River salmon is another blow to the Outer Bay of Fundy population. Atlantic salmon populations are affected globally by changing ocean conditions and overfishing. The news was not all bad. The only native populations of Atlantic salmon left in the U.S. are in Maine, where the most active salmon river is the Penobscot River. Dan Kircheis, a fisheries biologist with the National Marine Fisheries Service, has said nearly 850 salmon returned to the river in 2017, an improvement from 261 in 2014, but still fewer than more than the 1,950 that returned in 2009, according to fisheries service statistics. The improvement could be due to dam removals. Two dams on the lower Penobscot—one in Veazie, and one at Great Works—were removed over the past five years, dramatically increasing access to upstream habitat. New breakwater in Eastport While dams have come down on Maine rivers, a barrier went up in Eastport, which was good news for fishermen and other local boaters. Finishing touches on the new $15 million breakwater were due to be completed last fall with the installation of new floats alongside. Construction of the 100-foot-by-400-foot pier began after a catastrophic collapse of the inner half of the breakwater on Dec. 4, 2014. The new breakwater, which protects Eastport’s inner harbor and marina, is the same size, but was built 50-feet farther from the original pier, according to an article in The Working Waterfront. The project was completed by CPM of Freeport. The new steel pilings were driven into the ocean floor and filled with concrete, which was then topped with a concrete deck. The new pier also includes composite materials in place of steel in some parts since the plastic does not rust or otherwise decay. The port is deep enough to be accessed by container ships and remains active throughout the winter because the action of the 25-foot tides prevents the water from freezing. Endangered right whales Scientists who study the North Atlantic right whale estimate that the species will be doomed to extinction by 2040 if humans don’t make substantive changes to protect them, according to a report in the Portland Press Herald. A record 16 of the endangered whales were found dead last summer and fall, which is a lot considering that the estimated worldwide population of right whales is just 450. “At the rate we are killing them, we will have wiped out all existing breeding females in 23 years. That’s a very short period of time,” said Mark Baumgartner, a scientist from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. He chairs an international study group that convened the North Atlantic Right Whale Consortium in Halifax, Nova Scotia, last fall. Scientists at the meeting said options for saving the whales include making the ropes used in lobster and crab fisheries less deadly for the whales, and developing ropeless trap technologies in the future. The whales, many of which traditionally came to the waters off Lubec and Grand Manan Island, New Brunswick, in late summer to feed, began turning up dead in early June. Canadian authorities documented 12 dead right whales in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, while another four were found in the waters around Cape Cod. Conclusive necropsies for five of the whales found off Canada showed that one had become entangled in snow-crab fishing gear and four were apparently struck by ships. An additional whale showed signs of an “acute” death, suggestive of a ship strike, according to a report by the Fisheries and Oceans Canada. A necropsy performed on one of the four carcasses found around Cape Cod also determined it died of a blunt force trauma. Two other bodies were too decomposed to make a judgment. All aboard, next stop Rockland, Maine Coastal communities were thrilled this winter with the news that passenger train service could extend north of Brunswick. A proposed schedule for the pilot Downeaster Amtrak passenger train service along the coast to Rockland was being developed, with regular seasonal runs beginning as early as May. The Downeaster currently runs from Boston to Portland and on to Brunswick with some stops in between. The longer weekend runs would include stops in Bath, Wiscasset, Newcastle, and Rockland. Patricia Quinn, the executive director of the Northern New England Passenger Rail Authority, told Rockland City Manager Tom Luttrell that the pilot program is still in the exploratory stage, according to a story in the Bangor Daily News. The rail authority planned to do some test runs along the line in December and to hold forums in communities where the trains will stop to gather public feedback. Possible schedules were still being developed but the most recent proposal in late November was for the service to run May through October on weekends. The tentative schedule called for a train to leave Boston at 5 p.m. Friday and reach Rockland at 10:30 p.m. On Saturdays and Sundays, a train would leave Boston at 9:45 a.m. and arrive in Rockland at 3:20 p.m., Quinn said. The train would then leave Rockland at 3:55 p.m. and arrive back in Boston at 9:25 p.m. This schedule was designed to attract Boston area residents who want to avoid the heavy car traffic on summer weekends. Regular commuter train service ended in Rockland in 1959. Maine Eastern Railroad offered seasonal excursion passenger service between Rockland and Brunswick until 2015 when the state ended its contract with Maine Eastern Railroad and awarded a contract to Central Maine & Quebec Railway. Freight continues to run on the line. No shrimp fishing again this winter Despite several years with no commercial harvest of northern shrimp, the population of the tiny prawns (Pandalus borealis) remains too low to allow the fishery to be re-opened. The Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission’s Northern Shrimp Section on Nov. 30 extended its moratorium on commercial fishing for the 2018 season, according to a news release. The good news is that, as in past years, the section did approve a 13.3 metric ton research set aside, which means a limited amount of shrimp likely will be available for sale this winter. Stay tuned for additional details. The 2017 Stock Status Report for Gulf of Maine Northern Shrimp showed abundance and biomass indices for 2012–2017 are the lowest on record of the 34 year time series, with 2017 being the lowest observed. Recruitment since 2011 has been poor and includes the four smallest year classes on record, according to fisheries scientists. Recruitment of northern shrimp is related to both spawning biomass and ocean temperatures, with higher spawning biomass and colder temperatures producing stronger recruitment. Ocean temperatures in western Gulf of Maine shrimp habitat have increased over the past decade and reached unprecedented highs in the past several years. While 2014 and 2015 temperatures were cooler, 2016 and 2017 temperatures were again high, and the temperature is predicted to continue rising as a result of climate change. This suggests an increasingly inhospitable environment for northern shrimp and the need for strong conservation efforts to help restore the stock. In 2013, the most recent year the fishery was open, fewer than 600,000 lbs. of shrimp were harvested in the gulf. History being lost to shore erosion Warm oceans and rising sea levels have been taking a toll on shore, as well. Some 2,000 known shell middens in Maine are seriously threatened by rising sea levels, beach erosion, and real estate development, according to an article in the Bangor Daily News. Middens mark spots where Maine’s Native Americans feasted on clams, shells, and other seafood, then tossed aside the remains. These ancient garbage heaps contain information about Maine’s early environment and long-ago residents. A University of Maine project, funded by Maine Sea Grant, seeks to define the current extent of the middens and develop a network of citizen scientists to monitor and protect them. “The paleo information is priceless,” Alice Kelley, an associate research professor at the University of Maine Climate Change Institute, told the BDN. “The bones and the things that are there are basically our only record of what was living in the western Gulf of Maine from 4,000 years ago to the present.” Over the last two years, she and a UMaine crew have used ground-penetrating radar to define the thickness and extent of many of these middens. The project’s next step, Kelley said, will be to develop a protocol for a network of citizen “midden minders.” She also will help set up a website so the citizen scientists can send in their photos and data. Prospective minders are invited to send her an email at akelley@maine.edu. Who dropped the “bomb” on Maine' The type of storm that hit New England in late October, knocking out power to over 500,000 Maine homes, was an unusual meteorological event that weather forecasters referred to as a “bomb cyclone.” The unusual nickname stems from a phenomenon in which atmospheric pressure drops relatively quickly (technically, 24 millibars in 24 hours), whipping up the kind of sudden strong winds that hit the state in late October, according to a report in the BDN. Tens of thousands of Mainers went without power for more than a week as power crews came from across the country to help restore downed lines. The storm formed as moisture from Tropical Storm Philippe merged with an eastward-moving cold front, causing a rapid drop in air pressure and powerful winds. A weather buoy at Matinicus Rock in the Gulf of Maine recorded a wind gust of 92 mph while another at Isle of Shoals, on the Maine-New Hampshire border, recorded a wind gust of 82 mph, according to the National Weather Service. Damage in coastal harbors was extraordinary. At least six boats broke loose in Belfast and two were total losses. In Rockland, a local lobsterman’s boat was smashed up against rocks, creating large holes in the boat’s hull. A sailboat from Owls Head also was totaled. In Stonington, one commercial boat and a sailboat were destroyed, according to harbormaster Raelene Pert. The governor has asked for a disaster declaration to help the state recover from the storm, which knocked down more than 1,400 utility poles. Damage to public infrastructure exceeded $4.7 million, according to the governor’s request. New buildings for Artisan Artisan Boatworks in Rockport, Maine, has added a new storage building and paint bay to keep pace with its growing maintenance and storage business. Since starting the business in 2002, owner Alec Brainerd has carved out a niche restoring and building classic wooden sailboats and motoryachts. In recent years, the yard also has seen an increase in storage and maintenance work. The yard now employs 18 people. The new 5,800-square-foot storage building is an unheated wood-framed pole barn with metal siding and dirt floors that are better for wooden boat storage. The 1,600-square-foot paint shop features controls for humidity, dust, and ventilation, with heat provided by fast and efficient hot-water convectors, Brainerd said. The new structures bring the yard’s total building area to approximately 21,000 sq. ft. John Davee and his crew at Maine Coast Construction did the work. The yard received financial assistance from Eastern Maine Development and Bangor Savings Bank, Brainerd said.",neutral,seaweed aquaculture,2021,Maine

That’s partly because scallops are a perennial favorite at the seafood counter and partly because the wild scallop harvest, although currently healthy, is tightly monitored in order to prevent the fishery—on which many Maine fishermen rely throughout the winter months—from collapsing. Whether farmed or wild, these are Atlantic scallops, Plactopecten magellanicus. The wild harvest runs from mid-December to early April; each boat is limited to 15 gallons (about 135 pounds) of scallops daily. For that reason, almost all Maine scallops are harvested by day-boats. Farming scallops calls for a greater investment, in both labor and start-up costs, than oyster or mussel farming, and much more than cultivating seaweed. The grow-out, moreover, from start to maturity, can be as long as four years—a long time to have your money tied up in a scallop farm. Wild juvenile or larval spat are captured in spat bags in late summer or early fall as they drift through the water column, then moved to netted enclosures that protect them from predators such as green crabs and starfish. (Like mussels, oysters, and other bivalves, scallops feed on phytoplankton in the water.) Often that netted enclosure is a lantern net, an idea that Maine fishermen learned about in Japan, where traditionally scallops are grown in long tube-shaped nets, each one enclosing up to 10 platforms on which the scallops rest. The equipment is expensive, however: each lantern net costs $20 and a lot are needed to set up a system, plus all the rest of the equipment. The start-up costs can add up to an amount that can be a stretch, even for a well-funded fisherman. The market is there, especially in high-end restaurants. Chefs would love to have access to fresh scallops, complete with handsome coral gonads attached. This is currently not possible with wild scallops but might well be so with farmed ones, which can be tested more easily for biotoxins. Consequently, several people and organizations are experimenting with scallop aquaculture, including the non-profit Hurricane Island Center for Science and Leadership, which has worked with area students on research projects, raising kelp and scallops together, and studying the interactions with the wild populations. “We’re trying to answer the questions that growers are asking,” Phoebe Jekielek, the center’s director of research, told me, “but without getting in their way.

We’ve all heard stories about long bus rides, but what about boat rides' Five students, ages 5 to 13, who live on Islesford, rowed to school on Great Cranberry Island and back most days last fall, according to an article in the Ellsworth American. Rowing with them and making sure they were safe was Tony Archino, who teaches boatbuilding with Islesford Boatworks. He came up with the idea. On days when the weather was good, some or all of the Islesford students rowed the half mile or so over to Great Cranberry and Longfellow School in the morning and back home in the afternoon. It takes about half an hour to row from one island to the other. Sometimes, Longfellow Principal Lindsay Eysnogle, who also lives on Islesford, rowed with the students. They took the mailboat when winds or rain made the crossing too rough. Their boat was a 22-foot St. Ayles skiff. Support for edible “weed” research No, not that kind—seaweed. Several recent grants to Maine organizations are intended to promote edible seaweed production in Maine. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration awarded $908,015 to the University of Maine for research into sustainable post-harvest processing (such as drying, blanching, and freezing) of aquacultured seaweed and development of value-added products. The goal is to increase the capacity of Maine seaweed producers and processors. Meanwhile, the University of New England landed a U.S. Department of Energy grant for $1.32 million to develop a three-dimensional modeling tool to simulate hydrodynamic-induced mechanical stresses that seaweed farms face in the open ocean. That data could then be used to determine the structural performance of new and existing farm designs in the Gulf of Maine. A day with yacht designers Lyman-Morse Boatbuilding and the Cruising Club of America hosted a Yacht Designers Forum at the yard in Thomaston last October. The morning session was held on the third floor mezzanine of their boatshop. Nine of today’s best yacht designers exhibited small displays of their current work to share their knowledge with those of us who love boats, profess to know something about boats, and who quickly realized that these guys really know about boats. It was heady stuff. The Forum later moved to the Farnsworth Art Museum’s Wyeth Center for two sold-out panel discussions looking at the challenges facing the sport of boats, and the advances in the various aspects of design, ranging from propulsion, which is going through an incredible evolutionary spurt, through onboard systems, and the future of foiling. Participating yacht designers included: Peter Boyce of C. Raymond Hunt; Scott Jutson of Jutson Marine Design; David McCollough of McCollough Yachts; Ed Joy of Ed Joy Yacht Design; Chuck Paine of CW Paine Yacht Design; Jay Paris of Jay E. Paris Naval Architecture; Bob Stephens of Stephens Waring Yacht Design; Jim Taylor of Jim Taylor Yacht Designs; Paul Waring of Stephens Waring Yacht Design; and Doug Zurn of Zurn Yacht Design.

For the first time in 25 years of monitoring no wild Atlantic salmon returned from the sea this year to the Magaguadavic River fishway in New Brunswick, Canada, according to a report in the Quoddy Tides. This led to renewed charges by a wild salmon conservation organization about the impact of farmed salmon escapees on wild salmon runs. However, an area fish farming association defended the industry’s practices and called for a new approach to help the wild salmon population recover, according to the newspaper’s report. In 1983 the Department of Fisheries and Oceans estimated that 900 wild salmon entered the Magaguadavic River to spawn. But despite a multi-year cooperative stocking program, the number of wild salmon in the river continued to drop. The Atlantic Salmon Federation says the loss of wild Magaguadavic River salmon is another blow to the Outer Bay of Fundy population. Atlantic salmon populations are affected globally by changing ocean conditions and overfishing. The news was not all bad. The only native populations of Atlantic salmon left in the U.S. are in Maine, where the most active salmon river is the Penobscot River. Dan Kircheis, a fisheries biologist with the National Marine Fisheries Service, has said nearly 850 salmon returned to the river in 2017, an improvement from 261 in 2014, but still fewer than more than the 1,950 that returned in 2009, according to fisheries service statistics. The improvement could be due to dam removals. Two dams on the lower Penobscot—one in Veazie, and one at Great Works—were removed over the past five years, dramatically increasing access to upstream habitat. New breakwater in Eastport While dams have come down on Maine rivers, a barrier went up in Eastport, which was good news for fishermen and other local boaters. Finishing touches on the new $15 million breakwater were due to be completed last fall with the installation of new floats alongside. Construction of the 100-foot-by-400-foot pier began after a catastrophic collapse of the inner half of the breakwater on Dec. 4, 2014. The new breakwater, which protects Eastport’s inner harbor and marina, is the same size, but was built 50-feet farther from the original pier, according to an article in The Working Waterfront. The project was completed by CPM of Freeport. The new steel pilings were driven into the ocean floor and filled with concrete, which was then topped with a concrete deck. The new pier also includes composite materials in place of steel in some parts since the plastic does not rust or otherwise decay. The port is deep enough to be accessed by container ships and remains active throughout the winter because the action of the 25-foot tides prevents the water from freezing. Endangered right whales Scientists who study the North Atlantic right whale estimate that the species will be doomed to extinction by 2040 if humans don’t make substantive changes to protect them, according to a report in the Portland Press Herald. A record 16 of the endangered whales were found dead last summer and fall, which is a lot considering that the estimated worldwide population of right whales is just 450. “At the rate we are killing them, we will have wiped out all existing breeding females in 23 years. That’s a very short period of time,” said Mark Baumgartner, a scientist from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. He chairs an international study group that convened the North Atlantic Right Whale Consortium in Halifax, Nova Scotia, last fall. Scientists at the meeting said options for saving the whales include making the ropes used in lobster and crab fisheries less deadly for the whales, and developing ropeless trap technologies in the future. The whales, many of which traditionally came to the waters off Lubec and Grand Manan Island, New Brunswick, in late summer to feed, began turning up dead in early June. Canadian authorities documented 12 dead right whales in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, while another four were found in the waters around Cape Cod. Conclusive necropsies for five of the whales found off Canada showed that one had become entangled in snow-crab fishing gear and four were apparently struck by ships. An additional whale showed signs of an “acute” death, suggestive of a ship strike, according to a report by the Fisheries and Oceans Canada. A necropsy performed on one of the four carcasses found around Cape Cod also determined it died of a blunt force trauma. Two other bodies were too decomposed to make a judgment. All aboard, next stop Rockland, Maine Coastal communities were thrilled this winter with the news that passenger train service could extend north of Brunswick. A proposed schedule for the pilot Downeaster Amtrak passenger train service along the coast to Rockland was being developed, with regular seasonal runs beginning as early as May. The Downeaster currently runs from Boston to Portland and on to Brunswick with some stops in between. The longer weekend runs would include stops in Bath, Wiscasset, Newcastle, and Rockland. Patricia Quinn, the executive director of the Northern New England Passenger Rail Authority, told Rockland City Manager Tom Luttrell that the pilot program is still in the exploratory stage, according to a story in the Bangor Daily News. The rail authority planned to do some test runs along the line in December and to hold forums in communities where the trains will stop to gather public feedback. Possible schedules were still being developed but the most recent proposal in late November was for the service to run May through October on weekends. The tentative schedule called for a train to leave Boston at 5 p.m. Friday and reach Rockland at 10:30 p.m. On Saturdays and Sundays, a train would leave Boston at 9:45 a.m. and arrive in Rockland at 3:20 p.m., Quinn said. The train would then leave Rockland at 3:55 p.m. and arrive back in Boston at 9:25 p.m. This schedule was designed to attract Boston area residents who want to avoid the heavy car traffic on summer weekends. Regular commuter train service ended in Rockland in 1959.  Maine Eastern Railroad offered seasonal excursion passenger service between Rockland and Brunswick until 2015 when the state ended its contract with Maine Eastern Railroad and awarded a contract to Central Maine & Quebec Railway. Freight continues to run on the line. No shrimp fishing again this winter Despite several years with no commercial harvest of northern shrimp, the population of the tiny prawns (Pandalus borealis) remains too low to allow the fishery to be re-opened. The Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission’s Northern Shrimp Section on Nov. 30 extended its moratorium on commercial fishing for the 2018 season, according to a news release. The good news is that, as in past years, the section did approve a 13.3 metric ton research set aside, which means a limited amount of shrimp likely will be available for sale this winter. Stay tuned for additional details. The 2017 Stock Status Report for Gulf of Maine Northern Shrimp showed abundance and biomass indices for 2012–2017 are the lowest on record of the 34 year time series, with 2017 being the lowest observed. Recruitment since 2011 has been poor and includes the four smallest year classes on record, according to fisheries scientists. Recruitment of northern shrimp is related to both spawning biomass and ocean temperatures, with higher spawning biomass and colder temperatures producing stronger recruitment. Ocean temperatures in western Gulf of Maine shrimp habitat have increased over the past decade and reached unprecedented highs in the past several years. While 2014 and 2015 temperatures were cooler, 2016 and 2017 temperatures were again high, and the temperature is predicted to continue rising as a result of climate change. This suggests an increasingly inhospitable environment for northern shrimp and the need for strong conservation efforts to help restore the stock. In 2013, the most recent year the fishery was open, fewer than 600,000 lbs. of shrimp were harvested in the gulf. History being lost to shore erosion Warm oceans and rising sea levels have been taking a toll on shore, as well.  Some 2,000 known shell middens in Maine are seriously threatened by rising sea levels, beach erosion, and real estate development, according to an article in the Bangor Daily News. Middens mark spots where Maine’s Native Americans feasted on clams, shells, and other seafood, then tossed aside the remains. These ancient garbage heaps contain information about Maine’s early environment and long-ago residents.  A University of Maine project, funded by Maine Sea Grant, seeks to define the current extent of the middens and develop a network of citizen scientists to monitor and protect them. “The paleo information is priceless,” Alice Kelley, an associate research professor at the University of Maine Climate Change Institute, told the BDN. “The bones and the things that are there are basically our only record of what was living in the western Gulf of Maine from 4,000 years ago to the present.” Over the last two years, she and a UMaine crew have used ground-penetrating radar to define the thickness and extent of many of these middens. The project’s next step, Kelley said, will be to develop a protocol for a network of citizen “midden minders.” She also will help set up a website so the citizen scientists can send in their photos and data. Prospective minders are invited to send her an email at akelley@maine.edu. Who dropped the “bomb” on Maine' The type of storm that hit New England in late October, knocking out power to over 500,000 Maine homes, was an unusual meteorological event that weather forecasters referred to as a “bomb cyclone.” The unusual nickname stems from a phenomenon in which atmospheric pressure drops relatively quickly (technically, 24 millibars in 24 hours), whipping up the kind of sudden strong winds that hit the state in late October, according to a report in the BDN. Tens of thousands of Mainers went without power for more than a week as power crews came from across the country to help restore downed lines. The storm formed as moisture from Tropical Storm Philippe merged with an eastward-moving cold front, causing a rapid drop in air pressure and powerful winds. A weather buoy at Matinicus Rock in the Gulf of Maine recorded a wind gust of 92 mph while another at Isle of Shoals, on the Maine-New Hampshire border, recorded a wind gust of 82 mph, according to the National Weather Service. Damage in coastal harbors was extraordinary. At least six boats broke loose in Belfast and two were total losses. In Rockland, a local lobsterman’s boat was smashed up against rocks, creating large holes in the boat’s hull. A sailboat from Owls Head also was totaled. In Stonington, one commercial boat and a sailboat were destroyed, according to harbormaster Raelene Pert. The governor has asked for a disaster declaration to help the state recover from the storm, which knocked down more than 1,400 utility poles. Damage to public infrastructure exceeded $4.7 million, according to the governor’s request. New buildings for Artisan Artisan Boatworks in Rockport, Maine, has added a new storage building and paint bay to keep pace with its growing maintenance and storage business. Since starting the business in 2002, owner Alec Brainerd has carved out a niche restoring and building classic wooden sailboats and motoryachts. In recent years, the yard also has seen an increase in storage and maintenance work. The yard now employs 18 people. The new 5,800-square-foot storage building is an unheated wood-framed pole barn with metal siding and dirt floors that are better for wooden boat storage. The 1,600-square-foot paint shop features controls for humidity, dust, and ventilation, with heat provided by fast and efficient hot-water convectors, Brainerd said. The new structures bring the yard’s total building area to approximately 21,000 sq. ft. John Davee and his crew at Maine Coast Construction did the work. The yard received financial assistance from Eastern Maine Development and Bangor Savings Bank, Brainerd said.",neutral,seaweed aquaculture,2022,Maine
28,9537,Farmed Mussels Thrive as Wild Population Declines | Maine Boats Homes & Harbors,"Mytilus edulis, the common blue mussel, grows wild throughout the North Atlantic and was once prolific in Maine’s intertidal zones where thrifty Mainers harvested them by the bucketful (except for those who scorned them as poverty food). In recent years invasive green crabs and native eider ducks have decimated the wild intertidal population, but plump and succulent Maine mussels are still available because of shellfish farmers like Josh and Shey Conover at Marshall Cove and Flat Island off Islesboro. The couple, who also run a boatyard on Islesboro—where Josh is an active lobsterman with a string of 800 traps—are relative newcomers to mussel farming, although Josh worked briefly with Great Eastern, a pioneering Maine mussel farm that ceased operations around 2008. Shey had worked at the Island Institute in Rockland so it was natural for them to turn to the Institute’s Aquaculture Business Development Program for help connecting their start-up with others in the industry. Josh says he’s not a native islander. “I moved out there when I was 10 and I started right out lobster fishing with a friend, from a canoe,” he recalled. Why mussel farming' There is a lot of competition in oyster farming, not so much in mussels. “Besides, he was seeing changes in lobstering,” Shey interjected, “recognizing that both his body and the fishery may not last forever, but he’s always looking for things to do that will let him stay on the water.” Her own moment of light came after a talk by Maine Aquaculture Association’s director, Sebastian Belle, about economic diversification. “We should start a mussel farm!” she said, thinking it would give them a good winter activity to complement the boatyard and lobstering. “We were a little naïve,” she admitted. “Somehow it didn’t register that no matter what you’re doing in Maine, everything happens in June.” “The seasonality of it hasn’t been seamless,” Josh added. “We actually harvest year-round.” The Conovers’ mussel operations are based on large sturdy rafts anchored to the bottom; the mussels grow on hefty ropes suspended from the rafts. It’s not cheap to set up a mussel farm. Josh mentioned a figure of $6,000-$7,000—“but we already had the boats.” Still, once the rafts with their coiled ropes are in place, it’s just a question of waiting for mussel spawn floating past and attaching themselves, usually in the spring, which is around May in Islesboro waters. Toward the end of July, when the seed is set, the lines are uncoiled and let out. The mussels grow on the suspended lines until November, and then are stripped off and moved to a sock that gives then more space for growth. One raft of seeds, Shey said, should produce two rafts of product. In March 2020, the Conovers harvested around 3,000 pounds a week, selling the mussels for $2 a pound. In 2019 they harvested 200,000 pounds in all. “We’d like to get up to 6,000 pounds a week,” Josh said, “but we’re still very much on a ramp-up stage with our market.” Mussel farming has had its ups and downs in Maine over the years, beginning back in 1975 when the quasi-legendary Ed Myers applied for Maine Aquaculture License No. 1 to cultivate mussels in Clarks Cove, next to the Darling Center. Since then mussel farms have come and gone but the practice is now well-established with seven farms currently operating. The largest is Bangs Island Mussel Farms in Casco Bay where Gary and Matt Moretti, a father-son team, raise mussels along with sugar kelp. Farmed mussels are actually in greater demand than wild; they are larger, plumper, more meaty, connoisseurs say. Rope-grown mussels—stout ropes tightly clustered with blue-black mussels hanging from partially submerged rafts—is the method favored by most Maine mussel farmers. But an unusual technique, at least for Maine, was brought here by Theo DeKoning, a fifth-generation mussel farmer from the Netherlands who came to Maine in 2004, fell in love (who doesn’t') and brought his family and business to settle here in 2005. Acadia Aqua Farms, operated by Theo, his wife Fiona, and their sons Max and Alex, has leases in the Mt. Desert Narrows, between the big island and the mainland. The technique they employ, capturing wild mussel seed under license, then depositing the seed on the sea floor in protected areas, is typical of Dutch mussel farms and has a centuries-long history in the Low Countries. It has adapted well to the coast of Maine where the environment creates the robust flavors and substantial meats for which Hollander + DeKoning mussels are renowned. “They taste like Maine,” Fiona DeKoning said with evident pride. As newcomers to the state, indeed as foreigners, the DeKonings try hard, they said, to be respectful of their neighbors and their neighbors’ ideas, as well as to be responsible citizens—Fiona sits on the Maine Aquaculture Associations board of directors where she is vice president. Maine-grown mussels have a disadvantage in that they cost more than their equivalents from Prince Edward Island, where mussels are produced in almost industrial quantities. The test, however, is in the eating and most high-end chefs and restaurants agree that, grown slowly in our cold, salt-smacked waters, Maine mussels, with their intense flavor and meaty texture, are well worth the price.",bad,seaweed aquaculture,2022,Maine
29,9540,Three Futures for the Gulf of Maine | Maine Boats Homes & Harbors,"The waters of the Gulf of Maine are some of the fastest-warming in the world. From sea-level rise to ocean acidification, conditions are changing.  But what does that mean and what will the Gulf look like in 50 years' Renowned ocean scientist Jane Lubchenco was recently asked in an interview whether the ocean is doomed. Admittedly, it’s a heavy interview question, but it’s one that’s coming up more and more often. Plastic pollution, climate change, fishery collapses, and so on—are we pushing the ocean beyond its breaking point' Or is there enough resilience in the ocean and enough flexibility in our society to maintain a healthy ocean' Dr. Lubchenco responded that the ocean is too important for us to allow it to be doomed—it’s too integral to the planet’s life support. Still, the ocean is changing all around us. If we can’t answer whether the ocean is doomed, we should still ask what its future looks like. The Gulf of Maine, as it turns out, is a compelling place to dig into these questions. So much is changing so rapidly. In my work as an ocean forecaster, I try to figure out what the future looks like for places such as the Gulf of Maine. The first step toward shaping the future that we want is to chart the potential futures that might come about. I can tell you what the collective science says about the future of Maine’s waters. But like anyone who claims to know the future, I’m mostly going to talk about the past. Some years ago, I started visiting dozens of venues around Maine—churches, community centers, libraries, and classrooms. My hope was to tell the story of what climate change means for Maine at a local scale—not what it means for polar bears or coral reefs, but what the specific consequences will be  to whatever town I was visiting on that day. I hoped showing up in person, and letting people talk with a normal (if perhaps nerdy) scientist might cut through some of the politics and headlines that swirl around climate change. Yes, occasionally there is a climate denier who asks about volcanoes or cosmic rays. And I do sometimes run into what the great climate writer Mary Annaïse Heglar calls “climate de-nihilists”—those who, in their dismissive privilege, relish the doomed fate of humankind. But we Mainers are known for our pragmatism. Most of the people I’ve encountered have a good understanding of the general facts about climate change and want pragmatic answers to pragmatic questions—what are the particulars of what’s happening here' Which exact roads will flood, or how bad will the deer ticks get' Which fish will we be able to catch' Data on the Gulf of Maine show conditions that are changing more rapidly than other parts of the ocean. Long-term datasets inform models that can provide predictions on what the future of the ocean will  look like. Anyone who has been following news of the Gulf of Maine over the years knows by now that its waters are some of the fastest-warming in the world. The rapid warming was first noted 10 years ago, during what was determined to be a historic marine heat wave that lasted more than a year. Since then, what seemed like a clear narrative has become cloudier. On one day, you might read that the lobster industry is doomed to collapse in the throes of climate change. On the next day, the headlines are abuzz with record lobster profits. Some years, it seems that jellyfish are taking over, and then the story disappears without a trace. From whales to sea level rise to ocean acidification to puffin colonies, we know conditions are changing. All of these topics are nuanced and complex. With the confusing array of headlines out there, many people are left with their heads spinning. Where, exactly, are we headed' Mary Shelley once wrote, “Nothing is so painful to the human mind as a great and sudden change.” It’s difficult to understand change when in the midst of it. When confronted with this magnitude of change, people react in many different ways, from denial to despair. In times of crisis, I find that it helps to put things into historical perspective. To begin with, in all likelihood, the world’s oceans will outlast humanity. Whatever we might do to the planet—climate change, mass extinctions, even nuclear winter—the oceans will survive. If humankind inexplicably turned all of our resource and ingenuity toward wiping the oceans from the face of the Earth, I’m not convinced we could do it. The ocean has been through asteroid impacts that boiled its waters and blotted out the sun, into and out of ice ages, and under an atmosphere that for millennia would have been toxic to humans. Still it has persisted, and still it flourishes with life. From this cosmic point of view, the ocean is not doomed. If descriptions of an asteroid boiling the ocean are not that comforting, we can take a look at more recent times. This spot in midcoast Maine where I’m currently writing was once covered with a miles-thick sheet of ice—and it wasn’t that long ago. At the time when the most recent ice sheet was retreating from Maine, humans were already forming settlements around the world, some in places that would eventually morph into today’s modern cities including Aleppo and Damascus. Meanwhile, furry mammoth-like beasts called mastodons roamed across what is now the rich offshore fishing grounds of Georges Bank, which back then was pasture. We know this because mastodon tusks have been hauled up in fishing nets. The Gulf of Maine, at the time pre-Aleppo was being settled, would have been very different from today. Its waters would have been fresher due to the melting of the ice sheet and being almost totally cut off from the open ocean. There wouldn’t have been the colossal tides that these shores are now known for, and the sea life would have been completely different. Even in the intervening centuries, this has been a place of change—a place that, if compared to how we know the Gulf of Maine now, would be scarcely recognizable. Take herring gulls, fondly referred to today as “rats of the sky.” It’s hard to picture coastal Maine without them. But a little over a century ago, the species had been pushed to the brink of extinction largely by the millinery craft because people wanted to walk around with feathery hats. It was partly thanks to conservation efforts like the Migratory Bird Convention that we are lucky to have so many herring gulls decorating our skies (and dumps) today. If we were to hop back through time and visit the coast of Maine through the centuries, we’d see many different incarnations. At times we’d see coastal waters so dense with herring that tuna—now one of the most valuable fish on the market—was considered bycatch. At other times, we’d see fish swimming up our rivers by the billions. Imagine swordfish in Portland Harbor, or shoals of cod so dense as to slow the passage of ships. All of this is to say that the Gulf of Maine is not as timeless and immutable as it might appear on a postcard of Pemaquid Point. Things have been changing continuously over the millennia. Some of these changes have been traumatic to communities, like collapses of fisheries, while others have been gradual. None of this should undermine the significance of the changes that are happening now. Changes are coming faster and more frequently, and we expect that pattern to continue. But it’s important to remember as we look to the future that it’s unrealistic to think about conservation or preservation in some idealized, “natural” permanent state. Because the Gulf of Maine is so young, it has more or less been in a constant state of change. Before we jump to the future, let’s make one more stop to examine the changes that are happening now. I’d like to take you back to the marine heat wave that woke up the scientific community in 2012. Every year, scientists from all around the Gulf of Maine—from Cape Cod to Nova Scotia—gather to geek out about the goings-on in the Gulf at a meeting called by the awkward acronym “RARGOM.” At the 2013 RARGOM meeting, nobody could talk of anything but the 2012 marine heat wave. A water sample taken from Boothbay Harbor will be used in research to extract genetic information from microbes in the Gulf of Maine. The first speaker gave a case study in dramatic science presentations. He showed a graph of coastal water temperatures dating back to the 1600s. It is possible to recover that data from the shells of quahogs. Their shells grow in increments, a bit like the rings of a tree, with each ring recording what the climate is like at the time. The technique could, in principle, tell us what the water conditions were like on the year when the Titanic sank. Over the centuries, the temperatures in the graph went up and down, lining up with known events of climatic significance, such as major volcanic eruptions. The speaker then drew a new point on the graph, showing 2012. It was off the chart, warmer than anything in his record that covered hundreds of years. There we were in 2013 already dealing with temperatures that weren’t supposed to arrive until the end of the century. Each subsequent speaker told how the warm waters had affected their part of the Gulf of Maine. One dramatic graph, statistic, and diagram after the next showed the proliferation of comb jellies, the die-off of puffin chicks, the appearances of seahorses, black sea bass, longfin squid, and, somewhat inexplicably, Arctic bowhead whales. Reflecting on that year, now a decade later, I remember it as the last year we could find northern shrimp at fish markets, or walk along a shoreline wallpapered with blue mussels. Things changed in the blink of an eye. There’s an idea called “shifting baselines,” introduced to ocean science by Dr. Daniel Pauly. The basic idea is that when we look at the ocean today, we think about all of the things we want to conserve, forgetting what we’ve already lost over the preceding decades. In whatever time we are in, we take today as our baseline. We can still enjoy the ocean today, sail on its waves, eat its fish, view its wildlife, and feel like we have a healthy ocean. But next to the oceans of yesterday, when our shores overflowed with life, the coast of Maine is almost unrecognizable. Even 10 years ago, just before the marine heat wave hit, things were very different. So now we come to the question of the future. What is the future ocean that will make us forget what we’re used to today' Will we still see it as healthy, or dying' To what degree can we predict, or even shape, what is coming' It’s impossible to know for sure, of course, but I did claim to be an ocean forecaster a few paragraphs ago. There is a lot to unpack in this field of science, but I’ve broken it down here into three possible futures for the Gulf of Maine. Future 1: Business as Usual A century and a half ago, the science fiction writer Jules Verne speculated on the changing ocean, making his own forecast: “crowded with jellyfish, squid, and other devilfish, the oceans will have become huge centers of infection.” While jellyfish don’t “infect” the ocean (they just live there), Verne was playing forward the consequences of the intense extraction of sea life that was happening at the time. This is what climate scientists call the “Business as Usual” scenario: take the changes that are happening now and extrapolate them into the future. There are plenty of attempts in the scientific literature to predict what the ocean will look like in 50 or 100 years using similar methods. Usually these studies focus on one species or a group of related species. To credit Verne’s prediction, one study did reveal that cephalopods—that is, squids, octopuses, and cuttlefish (which the study refers to as “voracious and adaptable predators”)—are faring much better in the changing ocean and could proliferate in a warmer world. Another collection of studies notes the global rise of jellyfish, often arguing that human influences are leading toward an ocean dominated by jellyfish. Yet another collection of studies warns of the possible global rise of toxic algae. Put all of these studies together, and you get something like what Verne predicted—a warm, acidic, low-oxygen soup filled with a surprising diversity of jellyfish, squid, and plastic pollution, more common than fish, plus toxic algae and flooded cities wherever the land meets the sea. This type of predictive method was recently applied to the Gulf of Maine. In a 10-year follow-up to that original meeting about the 2012 heat wave, scientists from around the region got together (in another RARGOM meeting) to discuss what the Gulf of Maine could look like by the year 2050. Among other topics, the studies outlined the general warming trends, changing currents, projections for sea level rise and its effect on infrastructure, and ocean acidification along the Maine coast. Regarding lobster and whale populations, these are projected to change too. In the long term, many of the good whale feeding areas are predicted to move into Canadian waters. Lobsters are an interesting case, teetering on the edge—the “Business as Usual” scenarios mostly warm them out of coastal Maine, but with some reductions in emissions, they could hang on, especially downeast. The outlook for seabirds like puffins and razorbills was more uncertain, with evidence pointing in multiple directions, reflecting the challenge of trying to forecast something as complicated as a bird colony. Some of the findings were surprising to me. We’ve heard that sea level is rising, for example, due to melting of ice and thermal expansion (water expands when it warms). On top of this, though, we should expect 4-8 inches of additional sea level rise due to a change in the position of the Gulf Stream. That’s a significant prediction when it comes to rebuilding our roads and bridges. Some of the predictions for ocean acidification were surprising, as well. As the ocean absorbs carbon dioxide from fossil fuel emissions, it is becoming more acidic, potentially dissolving the shells of some sea life. The good news for the Gulf of Maine is that the warming works to slow the acidification process. The bad news is that deeper waters near the bottom—where many shellfish live—are projected to feel the effects of acidification even more than global models had previously predicted. The collection of studies was a remarkable, collaborative effort among scientists to paint a picture of a particular future, from the physics to the fish. But the question then becomes: is this future set in stone, or can we change course' Future 2: The Ghost of Climate Yet to Come The “Business as Usual” forecasts aren’t necessarily meant to be true predictions in the vein of a weather forecast. They are more of a call to action. It’s a bit like Dickens’s character The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, who shows Ebenezer Scrooge his lonely future funeral. Scrooge sees this forecast and asks in desperation if there is still time to change—and, of course, there is. This type of forecasting is called “reflexive prediction”—where the prediction itself changes the outcome. The “forecast” is a warning that comes true if ignored, but, if acted on, can lead to a reversal of the prediction. Reflexive predictions, if not used wisely, can lead to stock market crashes, flipped elections, and cosmic time-travel paradoxes. But if used wisely, they can avoid the worst of climate change. The scenarios outlined in “Future 1” are like the Ghosts of Climate Yet to Come. There are solid calculations indicating that these unsettling futures are likely to come to pass if we don’t change our path. But those calculations leave open the possibility that we can change course. As Scrooge pleads, “Assure me that I yet may change these shadows you have shown me, by an altered life!” What can we do, then, in the face of the warnings' The solution breaks down into two components, referred to as mitigation and adaptation. Mitigation means treating the source of the problem—reducing the greenhouse gas emissions. This is akin to a smoker quitting smoking altogether in the face of impending health problems. Adaptation, on the other hand, means acknowledging that change is happening, and trying to prepare and change with it. This is akin to the smoker trying to treat the symptoms. Mitigation has been an elusive goal, but there are people trying. The Paris Agreement is one example, where almost all of the nations in the world agreed to certain goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The uphill climb toward getting the world to agree to climate mitigation is ongoing. But there are local consequences for the Gulf of Maine. Cutting down on fossil fuels generally means replacing them with renewable energy sources. The Gulf of Maine has an abundance of renewable energy in the form of offshore wind. A future where climate change mitigation is taken seriously is one that probably includes a Gulf of Maine where offshore wind turbines are peppered among other marine activities, like fishing and aquaculture. When it comes to adaptation, the solutions are more piecemeal. Each adaptation solution addresses a particular climate symptom, of which there are many. For example, sea level rise means rebuilding coastal infrastructure with the future sea level, not the current sea level, in mind. With the ocean changing in so many ways, the list of potential adaptations is long, and it’s something that many government agencies, towns, and businesses are trying to grapple with. One of my favorite adaptations is the expansion of kelp farming—or sea vegetables. Kelp is the sort of crop where a grower doesn’t have to worry about drought or nutrient shortages (both consequences of changing climate). The growing of kelp, if done right, can counteract ocean acidification and provide healthy ocean habitat, and it’s extremely healthy (call me, Big Kelp). The downside, of course, is that people aren’t lining up to pay $40 for a kelp roll. Yet. Future 3: Permanent, Intolerable Uncertainty So far we’ve got two futures for the Gulf of Maine—one where the changes we’ve set in motion continue, unabated, leading to an unrecognizable and perhaps inhospitable ocean, and another where we’ve stepped up globally and locally to slow and adapt to the changes, one solution at a time. I’ve painted this as a contrast, but there is a lot of space in between these two futures. There are scenarios where we achieve some success and preserve some features of this coastal ecosystem, but lose out on others. I suspect that there is a third possible future, but here the tea leaves are hazy. This future involves rethinking our relationship with the Gulf of Maine and with the natural world. A lot of our conservation efforts are motivated by what are called “ecosystem services”—that is, the services that ecosystems provide to the benefit of humans. Often cited are food, energy, clean drinking water, a stable climate, medicinal compounds, and so on. If we are too destructive to the environment, the logic goes, we lose these services, and humanity suffers. Ergo, we conserve and preserve. The idea of ecosystem services has been a way to get people to listen to environmental concerns. Keeping a healthy ocean is justified insofar as it provides a service to humans. But it’s a tenuous basis for a relationship. Imagine if marriage counselors advised working on healthy partnerships in order to maintain “spousal services” (washing dishes, mowing the lawn, grocery shopping). If you don’t treat your spouse well, you might lose these essential spousal services. A new approach could involve moving away from the current servant-based relationship with the ocean. Scholars and thinkers have proposed alternate visions, ranging from a networked global system of ocean monitoring devices steered by artificial intelligence that links humankind with the natural world, to the simpler but probably more useful idea of coming to terms with our limited ability to control and manage nature. My intuition tells me that there is a way to think of the ocean as more of a partner than a resource—to listen to and work together with the ocean. But I don’t know exactly how we can do it, or if we even have time. I do know that the fate of humanity is tied to the fate of the ocean and that things are changing rapidly—probably more rapidly than they have in quite a long time. The science of prediction can only tell us so much, and from there we have to feel our way forward along the hazy path that is laid out. In the words of Ursula K. Le Guin, “The only thing that makes life possible is permanent, intolerable uncertainty: not knowing what comes next.”",neutral,seaweed aquaculture,2022,Maine
30,9545,New campus for Boothbay Sea and Science Center | Maine Boats Homes & Harbors,"After 10 years the Boothbay Sea and Science Center has a new home and will continue the tradition of working waterfront at the former estate of Mildred A. Carter on Linekin Bay, East Boothbay. Founded on values of inclusiveness, hands-on learning, and environmental stewardship, the science center will continue to offer innovative and experiential sea and science learning activities for youth ages 5 to 17. The organization has integrated marine science into its summer program of rowing and sailing and brought the Exploring the Science of Seaweed Farming program into Maine schools. The 2023 science center summer program will open June 19 on the new property on Carter Road in East Boothbay. Young “Mizzens” and “Stay s’ls” will participate in hands on learning activities that include oceanography, meterology, marine science as well as sailing and rowing in one-week sessions. Weekly topics unify the program across the age ranges; “All Hands-on Deck” (the history of shipbuilding in Maine) taps into artists, boat designers and shipwrights. “Do Rising Tides Lift All Boats” (Maine's living shoreline, erosion, and the ocean’s ecosystem) emphasizes BSSC's strong ties with marine scientists and the active collaboration with Bigelow Laboratories for Ocean Sciences, also in East Boothbay.  The new campus gives BSSC not just a permanent home, but expanded waterfront access with three piers, a boat shed, employee housing, and will allow BSSC to continue to expand from seasonal to year-round programming and provide the platform for after school programs such as a Science Club for middle-schoolers. Custom Float Services is working to prepare the main pier for the arrival of the young sea and science learners in June. Rob Whitten of Whitten Architects has developed a sketch concept for the use of BSSC's new home. Executive Director Pauline Dion continues to amass an ever-growing list of BSSC collaborations that include shipyards, boatbuilders, marine science labs, aquaculturists, seaweed farmers, research organizations, artists, musicians, and local schools.",neutral,seaweed aquaculture,2023,Maine
31,9562,Hurricane Island Unveils a New Research Station | Maine Boats Homes & Harbors,"Boaters passing by Hurricane Island recently might have noticed a decidedly modern-looking structure perched on one of the island’s old granite piers, just feet from the ocean’s edge. This new state-of-the-art field research station mark’s the island’s new life as a center for cutting-edge scientific research and education in a unique marine environment. For many years Hurricane Island provided a base for learning life skills in a watery setting as part of the Outward Bound program. More recently, the 125-acre island off Vinalhaven has been home to the nonprofit Hurricane Island Center for Science and Leadership, which hosts science camps for students and conducts marine research. Current projects include several involving the study of scallops and aquaculture. The island’s location in Penobscot Bay at the confluence of the eastern and western Maine coastal currents and near the discharge of freshwater from the Penobscot River make it an ideal place for research, according to University of Maine marine biologist Bob Steneck. Windows in the second floor lab look out over Hurricane Sound and the waters where students in the lab will conduct research. Gulf of Maine waters are warming faster than 99 percent of ocean waters worldwide, but there is little data to shed light on the causes and consequences of these changing ocean temperatures, Steneck said. The new research station will serve as a science facility and a hub to connect local students, teachers, scientists, community leaders, and fishermen in shared efforts to better understand the marine environment. The new building’s construction is as innovative as the research it will enable, according to speakers among the phalanx of politicians, marine biologists, trustees, and supporters, who trekked to the island last summer to celebrate the completion of the new structure. The structure, 1,100 square feet above and 1,100 square feet below, features a passive-house “envelope” that minimizes the building’s power consumption from the solar micro-grid that powers the Hurricane campus, keeping emissions and environmental impact to a minimum. The new building had not yet been finished last summer as fundraising continued to cover the cost of the $2 million structure. News in late August of a $500,000 THRIVE forgivable loan through the Finance Authority of Maine was a major boost. The building was designed and built by Belfast-based OPAL, whose executive partner, Matt O’Malia, was on hand for the August event. OPAL faced major logistical hurdles on the project, including working and delivering material to an unbridged island in harsh side-season conditions. The structure showcases the future role of sustainable Maine forestry products, O’Malia said, explaining that it is carbon-negative because the building materials—cross-laminated timber, glulam beams, and wood-fiber panels—store more carbon than was used to produce them. Sustainable building practices such as these will play a key role in combatting climate change, whose effects will be studied in the lab, O’Malia noted. “If we can build this on a rocky promontory in Penobscot Bay, we can take this model and replicate it across the country,” he said. “This project proves these buildings are possible.” The building is insulated with a wood fiber product. OPAL’s sister company TimberHP recently began manufacturing insulation in a former paper mill in Madison, using wood-fiber waste from the lumber industry, in a first-of-its kind operation in the United States. The new factory was not yet online when work began on the Hurricane Island structure, which meant its wood insulation had to be imported from Germany, O’Malia explained. While the structure has been completed, the building still needs to be fully equipped. Plans call for indoor flowing seawater tanks, which will allow scientists and students to interact with species in a controlled environment just a few hundred yards from the island’s experimental aquaculture site where scallops, kelp, mussels, oysters and other specimens can be grown or collected from the wild. Educational projects on the island include the development of a year-long high school curriculum in partnership with the North Haven Community School of interdisciplinary coastal study known as the Offshore Year, with emphasis on environmental science, civic engagement, and the arts. Hurricane Island trustees and supporters looked as Maine Gov. Janet Mills cut the ribbon,  actually a fishing rope, at last summer’s ceremony for the new field research station. Comparing the vast expenses of research vessels to the cost-effective opportunities of a centrally located and sustainable research station, Steneck said research around aquaculture at facilities such as this one is key. “What I’m seeing now throughout the state of Maine and the world is the rise of aquaculture, which has all these new questions that arise from it. We’ve got to have the science to know what’s going on and that’s why I’m so passionately in favor of this program,” he said. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, Hurricane Island was home to a thriving granite quarrying business, which collapsed suddenly leaving a ghost town on the island. Maine biologist Rick Wahle compared that collapse to changes now affecting Maine’s fishing communities. The lobster fishery, which Wahle called the country’s single most valuable species fishery, faces unprecedented challenges, as a result of ocean warming. Research stations like this one, he said, will be key to finding ways to diversify the fishing portfolio.",neutral,seaweed aquaculture,2023,Maine
32,9577,Scarborough rivers proposed for 3 oyster farms – The Forecaster,"More oysters could soon be farmed in local rivers.  Two lease applicants are holding a scoping session on Monday, Oct. 23, at 6 p.m. at the Scarborough Municipal building, 295 U.S. Route 1. Matthew Hassler and Robert Willette have scheduled the session, as required by the Maine Department of Marine Resources application process.  An email to the applicants was not returned by press time Thursday. The public scoping session “will discuss a proposed aquaculture lease application to raise American/Eastern oysters using suspended culture techniques in three proposed locations,” according to a press release from the DMR. Two of the three proposed locations are in the Nonesuch River in Scarborough and the third is in the Spurwink River on the border of Scarborough and Cape Elizabeth. Information provided by DMR indicates that more than 3 acres in the two areas on the Nonesuch River are in the lease application. The size was not indicated for the Spurwink River.  Willette is a member of the town’s Shellfish Conservation Commission and has served as the chairman. Town Councillor Peter Hayes, who serves as a liaison to the Shellfish Conservation Commission, said Nonesuch Oysters and Pine Point Oysters already operate oyster farms in the Nonesuch River.  Jeff Nichols, communications director for the DMR, said the session is the first step in the process of getting lease application approved. Notices are sent to communities and landowners adjacent to the lease site.  The sessions are designed to provide an opportunity for residents to learn about the proposals and to have an informal discussion with applicants.",good,seaweed aquaculture,2017,Maine
33,9579,Harpswell group hears warning about rising ocean acidity – The Forecaster,"For those paying attention to Maine’s shellfish industry, new predators who pose a threat to the shell-sporting species are hogging headlines. But another risk to the state’s coastal industries is perched on the horizon, with ominous, lesser-known outcomes that could potentially affect lobster, too. The waters are warming, and they’re also getting more acidic, Aaron Strong, a University of Maine scientist studying the gulf’s changing oceans, told the Harpswell Heritage Land Trust Oct. 17. Strong spoke about the looming threat of ocean acidification, a climate-change-induced plunging of ocean pH that is experiencing an especially rapid rate of occurrence along Maine’s coastline. His talk was part of the land trust’s series on Maine’s changing oceans. In his analogy, the damage by invasive green crabs and milky ribbon worms is something akin to an infection in Casco Bay’s clam flats – an acute problem with tangible consequences. Ocean acidification, on the other hand, is more like the sea’s rising blood pressure: a foreboding, chronic ailment with a hazier set of outcomes. Although one can guess. Strong’s provocatively titled talk –”Ocean Acidification: Will lobsters and clams disappear'” – hinted at the worst-case scenario: a more acidic ocean will prevent shelled creatures from forming their shells. He explained that acidification affects the amount of calcium carbonate in the water, which is needed to create a shell. The thought of Maine without lobsters – let alone clams and oysters – not only threatens the state’s tourism industry, but a $700 million industry that supports an entire coastline of fishing communities. Globally, scientists estimate economic damages in the hundreds of billions by 2100. Strong assured his audience that clam and lobster shells are not dissolving in Maine’s waters just yet. But he said he knows of oyster farmers – a key group in Maine’s emerging aquaculture industry – that have already felt the effects of changing carbonate levels on larval populations. At least one farmer left the state for Hawaii, he said. There is less known about how acidification will affect lobster shells, as opposed to clam and oyster shells. In more acidic environments, “we see craziness in the metabolism of juvenile lobsters,” Strong said. But he predicted around another two years of research is needed until scientists have a clearer picture of how lobsters could be affected. Rising water temperatures, which could affect larval populations, might pose a bigger threat, he added. But compared to the rest of the globe, he said, “the Gulf of Maine is uniquely vulnerable.” Increased carbon emissions are causing pH – the scale used in chemistry to measure acids and bases – to drop “really, really fast,” he explained. Other, more localized factors cause fluctuations, as well – such as nutrient pollution from septic and wastewater, and extreme weather. These escalated, environmental changes are hitting a state with a lot to lose in the absence of a productive ocean. Work is ongoing to combat the issue, Strong said, mostly as a grassroots effort by scientists, academics, and nonprofit organizations. Notably without state funding, they have formed councils to learn more about what local communities can do to help shield coastal industries, remediate waters, and slow the rate of change. If local drivers are accelerating acidification, Strong said communities like Harpswell might be able to play a direct role in those efforts. For example, the town can protect water quality through septic and wastewater management. To an extent, that is already on the town’s radar; selectmen and staff met with a Department of Marine Resource to discuss water quality during an August workshop. Setting up a more robust water quality monitoring network is a good place to start, Strong said. Right now, there are a few sensors in the bay that track pH levels and some chemical readings, including one near Chebeague Island. But Strong called for the expansion of those programs, which civilians are able to participate in as volunteers. With more data, scientists might be able to create “real-time ecological forecasts” to identify “hot spots” for shellfish harvesters – analogous to a weather report, he said. As far as remediation, there’s the promise of kelp farms. Through underwater photosynthesis, the seaweed has the potential to reverse the effects of greenhouse emissions, creating “a halo effect.” “Will a bunch of kelp farms change the system'” Strong asked. Like so many things, he reiterated, the answer is still unknown.",bad,seaweed aquaculture,2017,Maine
34,9584,"South Portland pier presents promise, problems – The Forecaster","The city is considering ways to improve the Portland Street Pier so it will better accommodate commercial fishermen and widen their reach to include the fast-growing aquaculture market. At a City Hall meeting Dec. 14 with officials and stakeholders about how to best utilize the pier, City Councilor Claude Morgan said the city must invest in repairs along with a vision for the property. The meeting was held to update stakeholders on the context for the pier project, as well as provide an opportunity for input. The city hired consulting and engineering firm GEI Consultants of Portland in November to conduct a site assessment, a conceptual design and a feasibility analysis. The consulting work will cost nearly $47,000 and is being paid for by a Maine Coastal Program grant awarded last spring.  In an overview of what are likely important considerations for the project, Sam Merrill of GEI, who lives close to the pier, said the structural framework is strong, although cosmetic improvements are needed. Expansion should also be considered, Merrill said. He added issues such as dredging, cold storage, the dimensions and the number of slips allowed all must be decided, as well as how to best mitigate wind currents. A follow-up meeting on the project is slated for April and will include design and economic comparisons. Assistant City Manager Josh Reny said the big picture includes economic development, and opportunities the pier could create for the city.  Morgan, who lives just a few blocks from the pier, said South Portland has a unique waterfront, although he identifies some of the uses as outdated, and said there is an opportunity to take something old and rebuild it anew. The pier, in Ferry Village, has been city-owned since the 19th century, when it was constructed for shipbuilding. The property now leases 15 slips to lobster and tuna fishermen from April to November. Revenue from those leases ranges from $20,000 to $25,000, on which the city breaks even, Reny said. As a result the pier is not self-sustaining. Challenges also include no business and maintenance plans for the pier and security concerns, he added. Scarborough lobsterman Rick Sullivan, who is now semi-retired and hauls about 200 traps off his 32-foot boat Whistler, has used the dock for about 30 years to set and take up his gear. He said ideally, the pier should be widened and made into a year-round wharf. He said if the area around the pier is dredged, it could be used year-round and would attract more fishermen. “I couldn’t do without it. You can’t find a berth to tie a boat anymore, it’s the only working pier we have,” Sullivan said, adding commercial water access is becoming scarce. “It’s a good working pier,” he said, adding the fishermen get along well and solve challenges amongst themselves.  But he said the pier needs improvements, noting some of its planks need replacing and although it has a winch on one side, the tide has to be right for fishermen to be able to use the device.  Sullivan, who is usually done fishing by early December, also said winter northeast winds are hard on the pier and docked boats. “It’s not made for it, it gets smashed up,” he said, arguing a concrete pier and steel pilings would be a sound investment. “They will have to spend a lot of money here for the future,” Sullivan said, adding he is glad the city is exploring options to update the structure.  Also at the meeting was Gulf of Maine Research Institute aquaculture program manager Chris Vonderweidt, who shared data from a study on the market outlook for aquaculture programs in the state.  “The bottom won’t fall out anytime soon,” Vonderweidt said, adding Maine-grown shellfish is considered the gold standard among American chefs and the market will take as much as the state can produce. GMRI is involved because it works with working waterfronts on economic development, and Vonderweidt said within 10 miles of the pier there are 50 start-up sites as well as six commercial leases to grow mussels, oysters and kelp.  The city is considering allowing designated space for aquaculture farmers to use the pier, but one aquaculture farmer in attendance said it is a year-round, everyday business, so seasonal facilities and seasonal access are automatic disadvantages. GEI’s Varoujan Hagopian said fishing and aquaculture have different ways and means of doing things, and sometimes, harmony between the two breaks down. “We need to understand that,” he said. Collectively, the city, consultants, and fisherman must identify a functional design that supports all needs, he said. Designs may be for half commercial fishing use and half aquaculture, or two piers may be built to accomodate both uses, Hagopian suggested. He added the breakwater needs to be bigger, and must adequately protect the pier. He said a rock breakwater takes up a lot of space, and a wave screen would offer the same protection from the winds and use less space. Hagopian acknowledged parking at the pier will be an issue, and the design will have to be creative in looking at the area, and not just the property boundary lines. The properties on either side of the pier are privately owned, he noted.  Portland’s waterfront coordinator, Bill Needelman, said he encourages the city to consider what’s possible at the pier despite its land constraints, and consider synergies with Portland. As an example, he said if fueling is difficult at the South Portland pier, the Portland fish pier is just across the river. “Don’t worry about missing certain components if you can look at other properties to make it a functional facility,” Needelman said.  The Portland Street Pier in South Portland is one of the only docks available for commercial fishermen in the city, which is considering investments in the property.",neutral,seaweed aquaculture,2017,Maine

37,9595,Mussel farm seeks expanded lease off Falmouth's Clapboard Island – The Forecaster,"Bangs Island Mussels is hoping to expand its aquaculture operation off Clapboard Island and has applied to the state for a new 20-year lease for 11 acres in Casco Bay. The Maine Department of Marine Resources will hold a public hearing on the proposal at 6 p.m. Thursday, Feb. 28, at Town Hall. The commissioner then has 120 days to issue a decision. The family owned company would continue to grow mussels, as well as kelp and scallops, according to Matthew Moretti, president of Wild Ocean Aquaculture, LLC, which conducts business as Bangs Island Mussels. The proposed lease will be evaluated under specific criteria, the Department of Marine Resources said in a press release, including its effect on shore access, navigation, fishing and any ecologically significant plants and animals. Copies of the Bangs Island Mussels lease application are available on the department’s website at www.maine.gov/dmr. Moretti said Bangs Island Mussels now operates four, 40-by-40-foot permanently anchored mussel rafts in just less than 2 acres of water off Clapboard Island, and another six rafts in 2 acres off Bangs Island, which is near Chebeague. With a total of 11 acres near Clapboard Island, Moretti said his company could operate up to 20 rafts, but said it’s likely that at peak production Bangs Island Mussels would have only 10 rafts in that location. The proposed lease site is at least 1,000 feet from the low tide mark, he added, so there is plenty of seaway for both commercial fishing and recreational boating. “Our business is based on a profound respect for the ocean … utilizing sustainable aquaculture practices” the company website states. “We call ourselves farmers, but really we’re facilitators, working with nature to create an ideal place for mussels to grow.” In addition to its two aquaculture sites, Bangs Island Mussels also leases space on a Portland wharf where it processes and stores the mussels, has an office and keeps its boats. Moretti said Bangs Island Mussels just completed a “record year,” producing 260,000 pounds of mussels, which were mostly sold to local seafood wholesalers. He said about half the crop stayed in Maine and the other half went out of state. He said there is increasing demand for mussels, which is “fantastic,” but that means “the lease expansion is an important step for us to remain viable. We want to keep growing the company so we need more area.” Moretti also said the company “is at the point where we want to scale up our kelp operations” and it’s also ready to begin experimenting with growing scallops, as well. Bangs Island Mussels has four full-time and six part-time employees, but with the new lease Moretti hopes to make all those positions full-time and perhaps add new positions over the next five years or so. Moretti said the population of wild mussels, especially in Southern Maine, is in decline, but “the base of our crop is still wild mussel seed,” which the company harvests at special times of the year. He said it takes about a year and a half for a mussel to grow from a seed to a harvestable size. Moretti said mussels are filter feeders “so location is very important and a lot of spots (in Casco Bay) wouldn’t work at all.” He said the waters off Clapboard Island are ideal in terms of depth, water currents, temperature, bottom type and overall flow. He founded Wild Ocean Aquaculture with his father, Gary, in 2010 and then purchased Bangs Island Mussels from its founder, Tollef Olsen, a few years later. “My father and I were originally attracted to mussel farming because it was the most environmentally responsible method of food production that we had ever heard of,” Moretti said. Seven years ago the duo began growing kelp and mussels together. Not surprisingly, Moretti is a fan of both and said the best way to eat mussels is steaming them in their own juices, which he pronounced “delicious.”  Bangs Island Mussels hopes to expand its current operation off Clapboard Island in Falmouth to 11 acres.  Bangs Island Mussels starts its aquaculture operation by harvesting wild mussel seed, then growing them on ropes attached to permanently anchored rafts.",neutral,seaweed aquaculture,2019,Maine
38,9598,Grants connect communities with Casco Bay estuaries – The Forecaster,"The Casco Bay Estuary Partnership awarded nearly $10,000 in grants to organizations in greater Portland and Harpswell to support creative and innovative ways of increasing community awareness about the bay’s marine resources. The Casco Bay Community Grant Awards are in their third year, according to Victoria Boundy, community engagement coordinator with the Casco Bay Estuary Partnership, or CBEP. The mission of the CBEP is to “help conserve the ecological integrity of Casco Bay and its watershed through science, public stewardship and effective management,” according to the organization’s website. Boundy said CBEP received nine proposals from area schools, nonprofit organizations and community groups. Four applicants were chosen, based mostly on their “strong community engagement component,” she said. Boundy said CBEP also likes to see “a clear connection to the themes and priorities of our 2016 Casco Bay Plan and strong demonstration of community support for the project.”  The grants are funded through the federal Environmental Protection Agency and the hope is that each project will “generate broad impact.” The Maine Island Trail Association, based in Portland, received $3,500 to help it better manage the impact of pets on the islands. Many visitors like to bring their dogs along, but pet waste “has resulted in disturbance to wildlife and habitat, threatened water quality, and a diminished nature experience for many island visitors,” the association said in its application. The grant will be used to train volunteers and create education and outreach strategies to remind visitors to the islands that the “leave no trace” ethic extends to pets as well as humans. Brian Marcaurelle, program director of the Maine Island Trail Association, said the effort would be targeted to three of the most heavily impacted islands on the trail: Jewell Island in Portland, Little Chebeague Island and Little Snow Island in Harpswell. Rowe Elementary School in Portland received a grant for $1,200 to build a special Story Walk along one of the public trails in the city. The Story Walk will be created by first- and second-grade students, who are already working with the Cumberland County Soil and Water Conservation District on an education unit that focuses on protecting water resources. Through the Story Walk, “students will be sharing knowledge with the wider community about how waterways connect, support, and enhance our communities,” the Rowe School application said. The Harpswell Heritage Land Trust received $2,800 to create a pop-up learning station that can be transferred to its various properties, and the Holbrook Community Foundation got $2,100 to educate the wider community about aquaculture initiatives in the New Meadows River. Boundy said the Casco Bay Estuary, where several rivers flow into the bay, provides “vital habitat for over 850 marine species from microscopic plants and animals to migrating fish, birds, seals and pilot whales.” “Humans also rely on estuaries for food, recreation, jobs, and protection from coastal storms,” she said, which is why “the health and resilience of Casco Bay’s estuaries” is so important and why it’s key for the wider community to take steps to “help protect and restore it.” Overall, Boundy said, “Casco Bay is a treasured place.” Pet pick up Marcaurelle, of the Maine Island Trail Association, said pet waste has been an ongoing concern for several years, particularly on islands located near important shellfish habitat or aquaculture operations. But, he said, the impact of pets on the island trail goes beyond just waste, which is why “the aim of this initiative is to inform pet owners about Leave No Trace best practices.” “We love pets,” Marcaurelle said, noting that many of the trail association staff and board members are pet owners themselves. But, he added, “our mission is to take proper care of the islands, and with that comes a responsibility to ensure that pets are not inadvertently impacting the (island ecology) or the enjoyment of the islands by others.” Marcaurelle said that Maine Island Trail Association staff and volunteers are encountering pets with increasing frequency. In addition, he said that the guidelines for island usage, which can vary from one island to the next, “has meant that pet rules and best practices are rarely followed.” While pets need places to run wild, “Maine’s coastal islands are not well suited for that kind of activity,” Marcaurelle said. “Island ecosystems are fragile. The soils are thin, the habitat is sensitive and the wildlife especially vulnerable.” He said that staff and volunteers have also been hearing from island visitors that their “quest for a peaceful wilderness experience was ruined by exuberant, barking dogs. The islands are for everyone’s enjoyment. If free-ranging pets infringe on the enjoyment of others, then that is something that MITA should try to address.” Marcaurelle said the Maine Island Trail Association would use its grant funding specifically to update its annual trail guide and mobile app, as well as to update island signage, including the installation of new signs. Volunteers and staff will also get training around ways to interact with pet owners “in a productive way,” he said. “This is really just the start of what will be an ongoing campaign aimed at minimizing pet impacts,” Marcaurelle said. Making conservation education fun Julia McLeod, outreach coordinator at the Harpswell Heritage Land Trust, said that helping families enjoy spending time outdoors together while also learning about Harpswell’s coastal environment are the goals behind the new pop-up learning station. The mobile station will include equipment and materials such as magnifying lenses, identification materials and nature-inspired art activities. McLeod said while the land trust has been offering a variety of family programs for several years, “we have noticed is that turnout varies greatly. The idea for the pop-up learning station is to create something really engaging and fun that families can do on a beautiful day when they don’t have other plans.” As a teacher, she said, “I believe that kids thrive when they have the opportunity to play, learn, create and explore in a minimally structured environment (and) by offering this opportunity for families, we are engaging both children and adults.” The learning station will include scavenger hunt activities, as well as “fun facts about Harpswell’s natural habitats, plants, animals and geology, (along with) information to help families understand the environmental issues facing Harpswell,” McLeod said. The grant will also be used to create a Story Walk and encourage kids to take part in nature-inspired art activities. In addition, the learning station will provide suggested photo opportunities to encourage families to post about their activities on social media. McLeod said the pop-up learning station would spend a month or two at one of the land trust’s preserves, before being moved to another location. “The station will be entirely outdoors and accessible at all times (and) we’ll refresh the information and activities based on the habitat we are moving it to.” She said the hope is to launch the learning station sometime in June and the idea is that “children will use their imaginations, get dirty, touch things and build a lifelong connection to the outdoors.” Learning about aquaculture Peter Griffi, treasurer of the Holbrook Community Foundation, said that “shellfish and seaweed aquaculture is a growing industry in Casco Bay and in the New Meadows River, in particular, (and the) proliferation of lease sites has been met with some community questions and concerns.” That’s why the foundation plans to use its grant to organize three boat tours to the aquaculture areas “to engage, inform and educate the community about this growing segment of our local marine economy,” Griffin said. Overall, the goal of the Holbrook Community Foundation is to support the local commercial fishing community and “provide opportunities for education about the marine environment and the changing marine economy,” according to its website. Griffin said the hope is that the boat tours and accompanying panel discussions “will also provide opportunities to nurture relationships between landowners, community leaders and the aquaculture community.” The boat tours will be offered in August and will provide an opportunity for participants to interact with experienced growers and to learn about the process of cultivating, harvesting and marketing oysters in particular, Griffin said. Two of the boat tours will be offered by Peter Milholland, captain of the Pamela B, of Seacoast Tours in Freeport and the third will be a sea kayak tour offered by registered Maine Guide Alicia Heyburn.  Dogs are an increasing problem for the Maine Island Trail Association, which is why the group is using a new Casco Bay Estuary Partnership grant to increase awareness that the leave no trace ethic applies to pets, too. Here people and their dogs enjoy camping on Little Snow Island.  Engaging families with conservation education has proven somewhat difficult, so the Harpswell Heritage Land Trust is using a new grant from the Casco Bay Estuary Partnership to create a pop-up learning station that kids and families can access at will.",good,seaweed aquaculture,2019,Maine
39,9615,"Planning to fish is difficult, but necessary","If you ask a lobsterman if he works from a business plan, the response might be something like, ""I'm trying to get through next week,"" or ""I take it year by year."" Some will say that they used to have one, but they stopped when the timing of the shed became so unpredictable. Uncertainty created by climate change would seem to reinforce short-term thinking. The shed hit three weeks early in 2012 because of the warmest ocean temperatures ever recorded in the Gulf of Maine. Five million pounds of lobster went to market early that year, prices collapsed, and fishermen lost $50 million in earnings. Any business plans that fishermen had for 2012 collapsed over the course of a month. Despite the increasingly unpredictable nature of the ocean, a panel discussion among fishermen at a recent forum on fisheries and climate change hosted by the Island Institute revealed longer-term thinking. Gear is the shortest-term investment lobstermen make. Lobstermen view gear purchases as a rolling investment. All 800 traps will be replaced at roughly $100 each (fully rigged up) on a five- to six-year basis. Electronics like radar and ""bottom machines"" can run $5,000 each and fishermen count on having to replace this equipment every seven to eight years. The engine will need to be replaced on a ten-year timetable.  The boat, well, it will last ""'til I'm done."" Certainly folks who buy new boats hope they will get 20-30 or more years from her, given that she could cost $250,000 or more. Now place these practical investments against what fishermen believe the future holds for the lobster fishery. It would seem that fishermen in their late 50s or older and who live northeast of Boothbay anticipate that they will be able to finish their careers lobstering. The guys in Casco Bay aren't as certain. For them, it's a matter of how far they want to chase lobsters. They could finish their career in the lobster fishery if they are willing to go offshore, a trend that is becoming standard among younger lobstermen in the bay. Younger folks view the future with great uncertainty. They aren't sure that the fishery will hold out at its current level of abundance for another 40 years. Some fishing Casco Bay already are taking action to diversify their fisheries incomes, buying permits for other fisheries, including leasing space for shellfish aquaculture. Younger fishermen in the Midcoast (and even in Stonington, the current record holder for being the highest volume-landing port) are in agreement. They aren't sure the lobster fishery will be able to support their families for the next 40-50 years. Those fishing along the Washington County coast see the population center for the species moving their way. This makes sense, since the center of the lobster fishery has moved 170 miles northeast since 1960 and it is still on the move. Fishermen Downeast see boom years ahead. Nevertheless, for most of the Maine coast, fishermen are beginning to think about diversifying their businesses because of the unpredictability created by an increasingly warm and acidic ocean. Fishermen are seeing squid and black sea bass in greater abundance and hope that these fisheries might help offset changes in the lobster fishery. Others are looking at diversifying into aquaculture. Kelp farming produces a harvestable crop within 1-2 years. Mussels take 2-3 years to grow to marketable size, while oyster aquaculture has a 4-5 year time frame. Lobster fishermen have the advantage of owning a boat, wire-bending equipment and general knowledge of fisheries and fisheries management. Perhaps most importantly of all, some fishermen might have the capital available to make investments right now that will diversify their family incomes five years from now and beyond. The most successful fishermen have always adapted to change. As the ocean becomes more volatile, a diversified fisheries business plan will clearly benefit fishing families and those of us who value them as neighbors, stewards of the ocean and contributors to our local economy.",neutral,seaweed aquaculture,2015,Maine
40,9620,"Northern Bay oyster lease granted, with conditions   | Castine Patriot | Penobscot Bay Press ","A 10-year lease to grow oysters in Northern Bay passed its final approval after Department of Marine Resources Commissioner Patrick Keliher signed a decision September 29 granting just over 19 acres to Taunton Bay Oyster Co.  However, applicant Mike Briggs did not get everything he asked for. A 3.54 acre tract near Aunt Molly Island was denied; a tract south of Sparks Island was modified from 4.8 acres to 3.64 to accommodate navigation, and suspended gear is banned May 1 to July 1; and bottom gear is prohibited on a 15.37 acre tract near Gravel Island, where 6.04 acres of surface gear and 15.37 acres of bottom culture are allowed.  Dragging, removal of eelgrass and powerwashing are prohibited throughout the lease site. “I’m not happy with the decision, but have always had plans for what I’d do depending on any condition that was imposed,” Briggs said.  Selectman Paul Bowen said he saw no positive impact on the town from the oyster farm. “For folks who are associated with the area, and riparian owners, I think it will make a substantial difference, not a positive one.” The lease runs for 10 years, and would grow upward of 3 million oysters annually. Briggs first presented his plan to the public in 2015 and formally submitted a lease application to the DMR in 2016. A public hearing in January 2017 spanned three days to allow for public testimony. Objections focused on increased noise and boat traffic, the presence of kelp and eelgrass beds, the impact on shorebirds, the seal population, and recreational and commercial use. “I make my living from Northern Bay,” Penobscot fisherman Stephen Bechard testified at the hearing.  The 12-mile length of Bagaduce River, with its warm, protected waters, is prized by shellfish growers and wildlife enthusiasts alike. Maine has deemed it an area of statewide ecological significance both for the waterfowl and wading birds that flock to it and for its conditions that are conducive to a productive shellfishery. (See maine.gov/dacf/mnap/focusarea/bagaduce_river_focus_area.pdf).  Aquaculture was identified as an area of economic growth in Maine 30 years ago when the DMR and state planning office, with funding from the U.S. Economic Development Administration, convened an Aquaculture Development Committee, with a mandate to identify the production issues that constrain production and devise a strategy for overcoming production impediments. Since then, aquaculture statewide has grown, especially in the last decade. According to a 2017 Maine Aquaculture Economic Impact Report issued by the University of Maine Aquaculture Research Institute, since 2007 the total economic impact of aquaculture has almost tripled from $50 million to $137 million dollars, annually. The top three species' Atlantic salmon, blue mussels and Eastern oysters.  The DMR’s authority is to grant, deny or modify lease applications based on legal criteria. “The DMR can’t promote aquaculture. We administer an aquaculture program,” then-DMR policy specialist Chris Vonderweidt said at the Northern Bay public hearing.  Briggs said he plans to start production in 2019, and will apply for new lease sites on either side of the Davis Narrows Bridge in Brooksville to compensate for the conditions imposed on the Northern Bay lease. “To ensure a continuous supply of oysters to your customers, you must have a backup plan for harvesting. …The only alternative I have is to apply for another few acres where dragging wouldn’t be prohibited.” Citizens may request judicial review within 40 days of the decision. Caren Plank, an intervenor and owner of Aunt Molly and Sparks islands, had no immediate comment but said she plans to review the situation further.",neutral,seaweed aquaculture,2018,Maine
41,9624,Kelp: It's What's For Dinner - Down East,"For the most part, the vendors rose to the challenge. Said Sam Gorelick, whose business card identified him as “Chief Dude” at Portland’s Fishin’ Ships, “It was a chance to try some cool trial-and-error.” Gorelick’s offerings included the High Thai’d — pollock coated with batter made from Thai basil, chili, and a sea algae known as Atlantic laver, topped with ginger and served with spicy Thai aioli. Charlie Ely, of Portland’s Locally Sauced burritos, faced a stiffer challenge: incorporating seaweed into Mexican food. He used sugar kelp. “We’ve been able to infuse it into our three main sauces: blueberry chipotle barbecue — that’s great with everything; it would go with toothpaste — citrus serrano, and mango habanero. Instead of a vinegar-based sauce, we use a citrus base and you need a little bit of salt with that. That’s where the seaweed plays a role. I take a simplistic approach with my sauces. Less is more — don’t take away from what’s there. So to be able to use seaweed as a salt substitute and actually use less of it — that’s dandy. I was surprised at how well it worked.” In this case, the judges weren’t celebrity chefs — they were families enjoying an outdoor festival on a sunny Saturday afternoon. Their verdicts on the seaweed smorgasbord' “Tasty. I’d order this again,” said Portland’s Beth Eilers, after trying Fishin’ Ships fish tacos made with dulse batter. Her husband, Mike Podolsky, had opted for Maine Grain Alliance’s wood-fired pizza topped with sugar kelp rings. “Not much taste, bad or good,” he said. “But it was a texture, and it gave it some [nutritional] oomph.” Beth and Mike’s two boys, Zeke and Eli, gave the pizza a thumbs-down. (You could almost hear Chopped host Ted Allen gently breaking the news: “Maine Grain Alliance — you’ve been chopped.”) The boys did, however, love the dessert round, thanks to Lear’s Old Fashioned Ice Cream of Wiscasset. Probably the most successful Lear’s creation was Low Tide, a ginger/citrus ice cream speckled with the same vibrant green sugar kelp that had failed to impress the boys as faux pepperoni. With seaweed, more so than with other foods, presentation matters. The Maine Seaweed Festival, which grew out of a coffee-shop conversation between Redmond and Krapf, is part of an effort by the state and the seaweed industry to rehabilitate seaweed’s image. “There’s just not a lot of awareness that we have all these amazing sea vegetables in our own backyard,” says Redmond. “What we’re talking about are beautiful, healthy, living sea plants.” Shep Erhart of Maine Coast Sea Vegetables harvests seaweed. “Seaweed is such an undervalued fishery,” agrees Krapf. “People don’t even realize that it is a recognized fishery here in Maine. And it’s ancient. This knowledge is indigenous — it’s not something that we’re just finding out.” While seaweed may seem exotic as a menu ingredient, Mainers have been using it as fertilizer since the earliest days of the colonists. (Back then it was called sea manure, suggesting that seaweed’s public-image problem isn’t new.) Rockweed is still used as fertilizer, and the harvest still comprises the bulk of the seaweed industry in Maine, although not everyone believes that’s a good thing (see “The Rockweed Controversy,” below). Only in recent decades has a small segment of harvesters focused on seaweed as a food source. Shep Erhart was one of the first. In 1970, he dropped out of medical school to pursue a different path, and he and his wife, Linnette, headed north from metro New York with the idea of settling on Prince Edward Island. “Long story short, we ended up in Franklin,” he says. “We were part of the first wave of back-to-the-landers up this way.” “What we’re talking about are beautiful, healthy, living sea plants.”  — Sarah Redmond The back-to-the-landers also waded into the water. “We were eating macrobiotically, and the most expensive thing on our menu was seaweed,” Erhart says. “We saw this [local] seaweed that looked just like the wakame, which is a Japanese seaweed. So we said, ‘Jeez, let’s try that.’ And we loved it. It was delicious — still one of my favorite seaweeds.” That wakame substitute was alaria, a brown kelp that Erhart first harvested at Schoodic Point. He and Linnette used it in a pot of miso soup. Soon they began experimenting with other types of seaweed, such as sugar kelp and dulse. Although Erhart’s earliest harvests were strictly for his own use (“We were way ahead of the curve on eating local”), he was soon shipping seaweed out of state as well. “We had this whole network of macrobiotic folks in Boston and New York,” he says, “and when they heard we had got this seaweed, they’d say, ‘Gee, send us a pound.’ So we’d go out and harvest a pound. And one thing led to another — very slowly.” By 1980, Erhart was the chief seaweed supplier for what was then the country’s largest natural-foods store, Boston’s Erehwon. (“That’s nowhere spelled backwards,” Erhart says. “Typical of the age.”) By 1992, Erhart’s company, Maine Coast Sea Vegetables, had moved out of his house and into a former machine shop in Franklin. The company, which has about 18 full-time employees, plans further expansion soon. Business spiked in 2011, when a tsunami triggered a meltdown at Japan’s Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant, releasing radioactive material across a wide region. Because seaweed is rich in natural iodine, it helps protect the thyroid from exposure to the radioactive variety. And because many consumers in the large Asian market feared contamination in the Pacific, they looked to the U.S. for sources of Atlantic seaweed. “Since Fukushima, we’ve just been slammed,” Erhart says. Ron Hinkle (left) and Jay Mayer stand nearly knee-deep in a boat full of sugar kelp, harvested off South Addison near Flat Island in outer Pleasant Bay. But seaweed offers more than iodine. Multiple studies have found that large-scale industrial agriculture, which emphasizes efficiency, leaches nutrients from the soil — and that, in turn, has led to a depletion of the vitamins and minerals in many fruits and vegetables in the produce section of your local market. Seaweed can more than make up the difference. In addition to its high protein content, for example, dulse “has got every mineral your body uses,” says Erhart. “It’s got relatively low carbohydrates and almost no fat. The nutrient profile is very positive.” Because of that, says Erhart, “Some people who are mineral deficient get around it and they go crazy. Before they know it, they’ve eaten a whole bag, like candy. And it won’t make you sick sick, but it will make you very thirsty and it can kind of buzz you out because it’s so energizing. Like anything, you need to eat it in moderation. A little bit goes a long way.” The colonists called it sea manure, suggesting seaweed’s image problem is not new. Because of that big bang for the nutritional buck, a handful of ambitious Mainers are bullish on seaweed’s future as a food source. “Maine is the first state in the U.S. to commercially farm kelp,” says Redmond. “We’re definitely leaders now. We already have aquaculture laws in place that give you a framework to start farming seaweed. A lot of other states don’t have a clear, established system, so their regulators are going, ‘We don’t even know what this is or how to deal with it — so you can’t do it.’ In Maine, the DMR [Department of Marine Resources] has a terrific set of guidelines. So in terms of trying to develop an industry, Maine is unique.” Maine Coast Sea Vegetables, which currently gets its seaweed from a network of independent harvesters (“Very independent,” Erhart says), is among the companies that have begun experimenting with the farmed variety. That raises a question: Will America cultivate a large enough appetite for kelp to justify large-scale cultivation' “Not as we sell it right now,” says Erhart. “It will probably have to be hidden in something, like a teabag or a morning croissant.” Like nearly everyone else connected with the seaweed industry, Olson, a native Mainer, loves the ocean. He enjoys navigating the gantlet of multicolored lobster buoys, smiling as he points out a pair of porpoises doing a synchronized-swimming routine. It’s mid-September and there’s a bite in the breeze, but Olson, a year-round surfer, is wearing flip-flops and shorts. “I hold out as long as I can,” he says. Fort Gorges, a mid-19th-century relic, is visible to starboard. To port looms a mammoth cruise ship, a symbol of the waterfront’s present. And full speed ahead, in the lee of Little Chebeague Island, lies a glimpse of what Olson hopes is a key to a promising future. It’s not much to look at. A 24-foot harvest barge, equipped with a couple of davits, is moored in relatively shallow water, away from the navigation channel and the lobster traps. The bottom is muddy here. Olson cuts the engine as he approaches, and the sudden quiet falls like a blanket. Olson grabs a buoy and hauls up some line, which looks fouled. But it isn’t; the green stuff is supposed to be there. Olson’s voice rises. “There’s one!” he says. “See that little guy waving'” Fluttering like a tiny green banner in the current is a baby sugar kelp. It’s only about 2 inches long. But by March it will be several feet long, growing at a rate of up to four inches a day at peak season. “Some people who are mineral deficient get around it, and they go crazy.”  — Shep Erhart Olson predicts that seaweed farming will grow just as fast along the Maine coast. “In 10 or 15 years,” he says, “I think seaweed could rival lobsters as an industry.” Mainers take such pronouncements with a grain of sea salt. Olson understands; he’s heard it all before. “I’m 58 years old, and having been involved in numerous fisheries, including mussels, urchins, etc., I have not seen a fishery that humankind cannot destroy in very short order,” he says. “We see farming kelp as being part of the solution as opposed to part of the problem.” Overharvesting has devastated conventional fin- and shellfisheries. Fish farms can help restore populations, but they can also introduce new problems, such as high concentrations of nitrogen. That’s where seaweed farms can, in theory, be part of the solution. “In Asia, they’ve started growing seaweed around these big salmon farms to absorb nutrients that burden the water column in the surrounding area,” says Erhart. “It’s called integrated aquaculture, or the fancy name for it is IMTA — integrated multi–trophic aquaculture.” Seaweed farms can complement existing fisheries in more ways than one. “Kelp is countercyclical,” says Olson. “We can plant it in September or October, even as late as November into December, and have it harvested by May and early June. That’s completely the opposite of the strong point of the lobster season.” Olson boasts that Ocean Approved is the first American seaweed farm “to take kelp from spore to table.” (The company develops sporophytes in the marine sciences lab at Southern Maine Community College; after four to six weeks, the young kelp plants are ready for the farm.) He rattles off facts, figures, and catch phrases with the practiced delivery of someone who has spent considerable time courting investors. That’s understandable; to succeed, kelp farming requires substantial buy-in, not just from the financial sector but also from researchers, regulators, and the working waterfront. “In 10 or 15 years, I think seaweed could rival lobsters as an industry.”  — Tolef Olson “What we need for infrastructure isn’t quite there yet,” says Redmond, whose broad job description includes work at the Center for Cooperative Aquaculture Research in Franklin, “because if you have a whole farm of kelp, you need to be able to get it out of the water and process it and find people to sell it to. We still need to build that whole chain in order to have people jump in on this and have it be commercially viable as a large-scale industry.” The most important link in the chain, of course, is the last one: the consumer. To become commercially viable, seaweed has to make the same transition that lobster made long ago — from off-putting to sought-after. That was the idea behind the food trucks at the Maine Seaweed Festival. “Part of what we wanted to do was to have people eat normal American foods that they like — like ice cream, burritos, and pizza — with seaweed in them,” Redmond says. “Just to show them that the idea isn’t that crazy. “It’s not about sitting down and eating a great big bowl of seaweed. It’s about figuring ways to incorporate it into your everyday foods. And by eating a little bit every day, over time you get the benefits.” The festival, incidentally, will be back at Southern Maine Community College this year on August 29 (for details, visit seaweedfest.com). If you go, try the chicken burrito with the citrus serrano sauce. You won’t even know there’s seaweed in there. But your body will.   Former lobsterman Doug Wood, of Bremen, is among the converts. “Lobster prices kept going down,” Wood says, “and I saw an opportunity to get into the seaweed business when a mechanical-harvest boat became available.” Now, Wood, who’s in his mid-40s, actually sees a future — something he hadn’t been able to do as a lobsterman. “I hope to be able to pass this on to my son,” he says. But some conservationists worry that Wood and others like him have simply traded one shortsighted plan for another. “If we take away too much rockweed, it’s not going to be ecologically sustainable,” says Robin Hadlock Seeley, a Cornell University marine biologist who serves as an academic advisor at the Shoals Marine Laboratory. “The problem is, we don’t know where that point is.” Seeley, who formed the Rockweed Coalition in 2008, has particular concerns about Cobscook Bay. “There’s a very tall rockweed forest there,” she says, “and companies are drawn to it.” The state has tried to broker a compromise in Cobscook Bay by creating no-harvest zones and limiting each harvester to one of 36 designated sectors to prevent overlap. It’s a first step in a long-range Rockweed Management Plan that’s bound to become more comprehensive with time. Unless the whole idea of rockweed management becomes moot. “The interesting thing is that the state sells us a license and they also patrol with wardens,” says Wood, “and yet they won’t claim exclusive ownership of the resource.” It all goes back to the Colonial Ordinance, which grants oceanfront property rights to the mean low-water mark in Maine, with exceptions for “fishing, fowling, and navigation.”  Harvesting seaweed, which is regulated as a fishery, while navigating the intertidal zone at high tide would seem to qualify under two of the ordinance’s three enumerated exceptions. Nevertheless, it says right on the harvest permit: “Since ownership of the seaweed in the intertidal zone is an unsettled question that only Maine courts can definitively answer, the State of Maine takes no position on (1) whether the public may harvest seaweed from those areas without interfering with the private property rights of the upland owner or (2) whether the upland property owners may prohibit the public harvest of seaweed in those areas.” And that probably means that those who don’t see eye to eye on rockweed harvesting will eventually see each other in court.",neutral,seaweed aquaculture,2015,Maine
43,9655,The Maine Microplastics Researcher Reenvisioning Aquaculture | Down East Magazine,"Stonington’s Abby Barrows dialed back a globetrotting research career to take over an oyster farm in her hometown. Now, she’s out to refashion the equipment of her new profession, to keep Maine’s booming aquaculture sector from fouling the waters it relies upon. We open on the rotating globe: some brown, a bit of green, but mostly the mottled blue of a single world ocean. Blooming with phytoplankton in its light-filled reaches and sheltering, in its depths, the bulk of the planet’s animal biomass, it covers some 71 percent of Earth’s surface. It churns with a confusion of wind-driven currents and deeper, colder ones, moving water along a great, 1,000-year circuit, from the North Atlantic to the southern seas and back, a global conveyor belt distributing nutrients and sweeping past and into the Gulf of Maine. Zooming in on the gulf, we see the tides massaging New England’s bedrock coastline, filling and draining its innumerable coves and estuaries and enfolding, in the gulf’s middle latitudes, clusters of granite islands, like those of Maine’s Deer Isle archipelago. There, near a village called Oceanville, the salt water surges between two forested necks, then presses through a narrow channel to fill a tendrilled cove streaked with strings of oyster floats. And there, tending them over the gunwale of a roughed-up scow, is Abby Barrows. A 37-year-old Stonington native, tanned and sinewy, Barrows pulls one floating bag at a time, unfastening it from its line and emptying its contents onto a sorting table, where she cleans and culls her oysters by hand. The largest and best she sorts into a few waiting harvest bags, to wash and deliver to customers later on. The rest she returns to their original bag, scrubbing away any fouling and giving it a good shake, to chip away the oysters’ brittle edges, before reattaching it to the line, flipped over from its prior orientation. It is a routine she has performed countless times since taking over her nearly 2½-acre aquaculture lease in Deer Isle’s Long Cove, in 2015. Along most of her lines, Barrows’s oystering gear is largely indistinguishable from gear found at any other Maine oyster farm that uses the floating-bag method. The rectangular mesh bags enclosing the oysters are made of high-density polyethylene — marine-grade plastic, it’s sometimes called — with foam or industrial-plastic floats, attached with plastic zip ties, to keep bags on the water’s surface. As long as the mesh is kept clean, water flows through, and the oysters feed by filtering algae particles from it, improving water quality in the process by removing excess nutrients and sediment. As oysters grow, they are transferred into bags with larger mesh, allowing more water, and thus more food, to flow through. But at Long Cove Sea Farm, one line of gear has a section that’s different from the others. Barrows is growing many of her pebble-size first-year oysters inside a set of experimental enclosures, cedar boxes with fine stainless-steel mesh on their tops and bottoms, their floats fastened on with stainless-steel ties. Some of the boxes are then enclosed in traditional plastic oyster bags, while others are set inside wire cages known as ranches. It’s a setup that eschews much of the plastic materials that oyster farms typically rely on, the first baby steps of a USDA-funded project to identify, test, and compare alternative materials. For Barrows, the project is an extension of a professional interest and personal fixation that has shaped the last 10 years of her life, one that has sent her around the world, earned her the cooperation of thousands of volunteer researchers, and garnered attention from the World Health Organization, the National Geographic Society, and others. Its focus is microplastics, a class of polymer fragments that includes tiny pellets manufactured for commercial and industrial use (say, exfoliating beads in shower gel), as well as shreds and fibers of degrading plastic-based products: fleece jackets in the washing machine, car tires losing tread, oyster bags and other marine gear corroded by wind and waves.  Today, microplastic pollution is a rapidly emerging field of scientific study and increasingly covered in the popular press — sometimes with apocalyptic overtones. But 10 years ago, when Barrows first learned of its existence, there was so little awareness around microplastics that the then-journeyman scientist was captivated by their obscurity. It was like she’d discovered an asteroid hurtling towards Earth before anyone had heard of asteroids. “I thought, this is a huge issue that no one knows about,” she says. “I live in a community that relies on the ocean, and no one is talking about this or aware of this — no one even knows what’s happening.” Barrows grew up on the water, but at a remove from the deeply entrenched fishing culture of Deer Isle, the woolly island at the east end of Penobscot Bay where the port town of Stonington has long been the hub. The bridge connecting Deer Isle to the mainland was fewer than 30 years old when Barrows’s dad moved from Connecticut to Stonington, in 1968. On an impulse, fresh out of college, Nat Barrows purchased the town’s weekly newspaper, and though he later founded an influential commercial-fishing trade publication, he was not a fisherman. Barrows’s mother, a nurse and native New Jerseyian, was an inveterate sailor and imparted to her children a love of boating and the ocean. As a kid, Barrows says, “I was always tooling around in little boats.” Her parents had a small farm, and she grew up loving animals. After high school, she and her boyfriend — now husband, Ben Jackson — went to Australia to volunteer on organic farms. Barrows loved Deer Isle, but she had a teenager’s angst and itchy feet. Her plane ticket down under was one-way. In 2003, she enrolled at a public university south of Sydney to study marine biology. A year in, she met a grad student who invited her onto a research team mapping old-growth forests in Tasmania, and she fell in love with her second island. Barrows transferred schools and spent her remaining college years crew-hopping in Tasmania: she trapped Tasmanian devils to study their facial tumors, dissected feral cats to investigate their stomach contents, surveyed endangered parrots on a remote mountainside. “In Tasmania, I realized science is what I really wanted to do,” she says. “It reinforced my initial urges: I like getting dirty. I love the fieldwork.” A zoology degree in hand, Barrows took a job managing assistants on a seahorse survey off Papua New Guinea. Her crew worked out of a research station on a roadless island called Motupore. “It was ringed by mangroves on one side,” Barrows remembers, “and you’d just be up to your knees in the mangroves in trash. Any kind of plastic you can imagine — water bottles, whatever.” It was ocean flotsam, not left by locals. “People there are in dugout canoes, still very much subsistence living,” she says. “So seeing all that was pretty wild.” On another Papuan island, the first thing she saw upon stepping ashore was a large pile of partially burned plastic bags. On a boat trip in West Papua, on which passengers were offered Styrofoam containers of fish heads and rice, she stood on the top deck to look back at the boat’s wake. “I remember just seeing trash bag after trash bag full of Styrofoam,” she says. It started dawning on her what a crisis ocean plastics had become.  Following further travels — Nepal, the Middle East, Scotland — Barrows returned to Deer Isle in 2009. “The longer I was away, the more I realized what a unique and special community this is,” she says. She took temporary jobs — thirding on a lobsterboat, substitute teaching — while chasing short-term fieldwork around the globe. Everywhere she went, she saw plastic. Surveying sea turtles in Uruguay and Costa Rica, she found loggerheads with stomachs full of it or fins amputated after being caught in it. Advertisement In 2011, Barrows took a job coordinating education programming at Blue Hill’s Marine & Environmental Research Institute, a nonprofit focused on environmental health. (Today, it’s known as the Shaw Institute, for its founder, Dr. Susan Shaw.) Martha Bell was the institute’s education director and remembers hiring Barrows after a phone interview. “She had gone off and traveled the world, done her independent thing, and was just kind of coming back to the community,” Bell says. “She had that knack for communicating science. From the very beginning, she was able to really read her audience well.” Barrows played tour guide on eco-cruises and designed curricula for youth programming focused on marine conservation, with occasional guest speakers. One was an undergraduate at Bar Harbor’s College of the Atlantic, Marina Garland, whose senior project focused on ocean plastics. During a semester at sea, Garland had learned from a professor to search seawater samples for microplastic particles using a microscope. She showed Barrows and her students, and when Barrows took her turn looking down the ocular, she felt a switch flip. “The microplastics just got to me,” she says. “I had no clue.” Soon, Bell and Barrows were incorporating microplastics sampling into their youth programming. “The teens were just wowed by it,” Bell recalls. “We had a whole setup at MERI where we were filtering and looking at samples. Anyone who came through, we’d show them the microplastics, and people would say, ‘Oh my god, I can’t believe this.’” Almost overnight, Barrows found herself preoccupied with determining where the plastic motes were coming from and where in the natural environment they might be found.  “How much plastic we use, how much pollution is going into the water, how much our synthetic clothing has a role — that’s the thing I’d always talk about with people,” Barrows says. “‘My L.L.Bean polar fleece can shed thousands of microfibers that are basically going directly into our waterways'’ And not only when you wash it, but when you dry it and when you wear it, it’s shedding.” She laughs. “I was such a shitty person to go to a party with for a few years.” Now, we’re zooming in close, seeing what Barrows saw under the microscope: A confetti of colorful squiggles, some of them tangled, like bits of string in a junk drawer. These, from synthetic fabrics, are known as microfibers. Miniature marbles the color of sea glass, called microbeads when they make your toothpaste abrasive, called “nurdles” when they’re to be melted and poured into molds. Indistinct crumbles like chunks of mined ore. These are fragments of Styrofoam and other plastic goods, broken down by entropy and UV light. Scientists define microplastics as plastic particles smaller than five millimeters across. A British marine biologist coined the term in 2004, but as of a decade ago, when Barrows’s interest was piqued, there were only a handful of peer-reviewed papers evaluating their abundance, distribution, or effects on ecosystems. The scholarship is more robust today, though much of the science remains hazy. Lab studies, for example, suggest that marine organisms ingesting microplastics may reproduce less successfully, sustain tissue damage, and suffer nutritionally. But how well those studies mimic the natural environment is an open question. More certain is the fact that many plastics contain additives — pigments, say, or stabilizers — known to be carcinogens or endocrine disruptors.  What most concerns Barrows is that microplastics are known to accumulate persistent organic pollutants. Known as POPs or “forever chemicals,” they’re a class of contaminants that includes the pesticide DDT and dioxins from paper mills, and they linger in the environment long after their use. Studies show concentrations of POPs in microplastic pellets many orders of magnitude higher than in the seawater they float in. Researchers disagree over whether those toxins can readily transfer from a plastic particle to an organism that consumes it, but Barrows isn’t the only scientist made nervous by the possibility. In 2013, Barrows transitioned from education to research at MERI, taking over the institute’s water-quality monitoring program. Testing water samples from sites across Blue Hill and Penobscot bays, she initiated Maine’s first baseline-data map of microplastic pollution. She launched a food-web study analyzing tissue from Maine mackerel and shellfish (including oysters and lobsters), identifying microplastic particles in 96 percent of the samples. Seeking the best way to gather water samples, she led a comparison study and authored a paper illustrating that plankton nets, the most-used method for sampling microplastics, were inferior to simple “grab samples” — that is, jars filled by hand. When Barrows wanted to take her data collection global, she approached a nascent Montana-based nonprofit called Adventure Scientists. Founded in 2011 by Gregg Treinish, an accomplished backpacker and wilderness educator, the organization aims to recruit and train hardcore outdoorspeople — mountaineers, kayakers, and the like — to collect samples and data from remote, often hairy corners of the globe. Barrows reached out to Treinish, who was hungry for meaningful partnerships and knew MERI by reputation. Together, Barrows and Adventure Scientists launched what would become a five-year effort to gather and analyze samples from all the world’s oceans and from freshwater sites as well, creating the world’s largest microplastics data set.  Barrows designed a field methodology for thousands of adventurers who would collect some 2,400 samples from Greenland to Antarctica, Maine to Madagascar to Myanmar. She did the lab work through MERI at first; then, when the institute changed its research focus in 2015, Adventure Scientists put her on its payroll. She set up her own lab in a rented space in Stonington and enrolled as a grad student at College of the Atlantic — to the surprise of Treinish, who hadn’t realized his principal investigator did not have an advanced degree. “It goes to show that if you have passion about an issue and a hunger for knowledge, like Abby does, you can have a pretty big impact anyway,” Treinish says. “She quickly has become a leader in the field, to the point where her old email address here, I still get requests all the time for her to review papers, to do magazine articles, to be a speaker.” Advertisement The project picked up media traction, not least because its citizen scientists included Arctic explorers, pro surfers, and other high-profile adventure travelers. When Barrows and her collaborators published their results in a peer-reviewed journal article in 2018, it made a splash, concluding that every major ocean basin on the planet is contaminated with microplastics at substantially higher concentrations than models suggested. Some 74 percent of the project’s samples contained microplastic pollution, 90 percent of which were microfibers. The Gulf of Maine was second only to the Caribbean in having the highest amounts of microplastics of any sampled region in the Atlantic.  The Global Microplastics Initiative considerably boosted Adventure Scientists’ profile. Barrows was invited to speak at conferences and marine-education events worldwide. Data from the project, free and open-source, continues to aid researchers. “More than 250 institutions have used the data set, from middle-school students using it for reports up through the World Health Organization and the EPA using it to help create maximum contamination limits,” Treinish says. “I do think we helped get microplastics on the map at places like National Geographic and TED. In 2014, nobody was talking about microplastics. The fact that you can now ask probably 70 percent of Americans what a microplastic is and they’ll know' That was not the case when we started.” At an outdoor cleaning station behind her childhood home, Barrows sprays grit off oysters from her morning harvest. Her year-old Lab-terrier mix, Fife, prances around her legs (“pandemic puppy,” she says). Nearby, she and her husband are building their own house, every step themselves, right down to milling their own lumber. Until it’s done, they’ve alternated house-sitting, living in a trailer, and staying with Barrows’s dad in the house she grew up in. (Her mother, Ann, died of breast cancer in 2014.) On a back porch, she’s set up a pickup station for customers, with a fridge full of oyster orders, a selection of wine bottles, a basket of oyster knives, and a few Long Cove Sea Farm totes. One day in 2015, as the Adventure Scientists project was getting started, Barrows called a local grower to ask whether she could buy a few oysters. The grower said she was out, but how would Barrows like to buy the whole farm' She’d never tasted an oyster until she was in her 20s — “not a big thing growing up in Stonington,” she says — but she’d nursed an interest in aquaculture because of oysters’ water-quality benefits. She bought the farm as a sort of side hustle. “I was a total weekend warrior at first,” she says. But in 2018, with her master’s degree and the Global Microplastics Initiative wrapping up, she realized it was time for a change. That March, she was prepping for a trip — a conference in San Diego, then a pollution-education junket in Indonesia — when she learned she was pregnant. “I recognized this was going to be my last hurrah for a while,” she says. “It was a great run. I did tons of speaking engagements. I got to go on really cool expeditions. Now, I could just focus on being a mom and trying to run my own business.” Her daughter, Io, was born that November. Come spring, Barrows was setting up a pack-and-play in her oyster scow so the baby could join her parents tending gear. That summer, Barrows headed down east to speak about microplastics at an event called the Seaweed Symposium. She was invited by Severine von Tscharner Fleming, a farmer, seaweed cultivator, and beginning oyster grower who directs the Pembroke-based Greenhorns, a media and education collective focused on small-scale farming. After Barrows’s presentation, von Tscharner Fleming piped up from the audience to ask what Barrows planned to study next. Barrows, sounding a bit pensive, said she hadn’t quite figured out how to direct the energy she’d put into microplastics research.  “I would really love to marry the oyster farm with some of the plastics studies,” she said, “figuring out some ways to do some gear experimentation.” Afterwards, von Tscharner Fleming approached Barrows about working together on a grant proposal, and this spring, they were awarded $15,000 by the USDA’s Northeast Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education Program, to “identify durable, inexpensive, ecologically friendly materials for aquaculture systems, especially oyster cultivation.” Barrows’s cedar-box setup at Long Cove represents the project’s infancy. The plan is for those baby oysters to try out a number of alternative gear arrangements during the two years they’re in the water. When they’re big enough, Barrows will transfer them into metal-mesh bags. Already ordered is a supply of cork and mycelium, a buoyant fungus, that Barrows and von Tscharner Fleming will fashion into plastic-free floats. Their grant proposes experimenting with a number of biomaterials, including slatted wooden crates in lieu of polyethylene bags, linen and hemp rope to replace zip ties, and pumice and coconuts for floats. Throughout the growing season, Barrows is collecting data — oyster size, water temperature and salinity, levels of fouling, and more — to compare the experimental-gear group with a conventional-gear control group.  Right now, she says, the amount of plastic that oystering brings to Maine’s waters may seem trivial. But that volume could skyrocket as Maine aquaculture continues to boom. From 2010 to 2019, Maine’s growers went from harvesting roughly 3 million oysters a year to a bit shy of 14 million. The number of shellfish leases jumped by more than a third during that time. Marine gear accounts for perhaps 20 percent of the eight million tons of plastic that makes its way into the oceans each year. And while pushing alternative gear may be daunting in an established fishery like, say, lobstering, Barrows sees these early days of Maine oystering as a chance to forge a more sustainable path while there’s still comparatively little gear in the water. “Aquaculture is going to be a big part of Maine’s future,” she says. “We have this opportunity to rethink our current systems and materials, so why shouldn’t we' There may be bigger fish to fry, but this is an opportunity that’s kind of a no-brainer.” Sebastian Belle, executive director of the Maine Aquaculture Association, says Maine’s sea farmers tend to have a DIY ethos and a zeal for innovation, not to mention a reverence for water quality. “Cost is always a factor,” he says, “but there’s no doubt that if there was a product out there that held up, was strong enough to survive wave action and storms, was easy to recycle if it’s recyclable, and was better than plastic — I’m sure there would be a great deal of interest.” Barrows hopes that, within a few years, Long Cove Sea Farm can be a model of what plastic-free — or, at least, plastic-reduced — aquaculture might look like.  Von Tscharner Fleming, who’s also testing alternative gear, in Pembroke, thinks Barrows can drive the conversation, as she did with microplastics. “Abby is an aqua-babe,” she says. “She’s somebody who inspires other people, and to the extent that you have inspiring people demonstrating what’s viable and explaining best practices, that does put us on a better path.” When her oysters are washed and bagged, Barrows hops in her Mazda minivan to make deliveries. She’s still a small operation, moving 1,000 to 1,500 oysters per week, all locally, some through pop-ups at events and some to restaurants like Deer Isle’s Aragosta or the Brooklin Inn. Her oysters have their devotees. They’re creamy, and because Long Cove has less freshwater input than oyster-growing rivers and a big tidal flush renewing its waters, they taste notably briny and clean. They taste like the ocean.",good,seaweed aquaculture,2021,Maine
44,9657,8 Ways Maine Organizations Are Giving Back | Down East Magazine Magazine,"The tireless champions of the nonprofit community are doing their part to make the Pine Tree State a better place.  As director of constituent outreach and legislative affairs in the Pennsylvania state legislature, Galen Weibley loved working in public service. But he did not love his long commute on congested roads, which meant he only had time to go fishing on weekends. All that changed in 2019, when Weibley got a job as the director of economic and community development for the city of Presque Isle, in Aroostook County. He’s pursuing his professional goals, but he works closer to home, so he doesn’t feel like he has to choose between making a living and having a life. “After work, I can go get my dog and my tackle and be out on the water in 30 minutes,” he says. An increasing number of people like Weibley are discovering that Maine is more than just a great place to take a vacation — it’s an ideal place to build a business, advance a career, raise a family, and find the kind of work-life balance that is hard to come by in many other locales. Thousands of people have relocated to Maine over the past five years, thanks in part to Live + Work in Maine, a statewide initiative that helps Maine employers connect with job seekers and spreads the message about local professional opportunities. “We often attract people who enjoy the outdoors. They see a lot more opportunity to do that here than they do in New York City,” MaineHealth vice president of talent Helene Kennedy says. What’s more, she adds, in Maine, newcomers discover more opportunities for connection than they could in big cities and sprawling suburbs. “There is something about the community feeling people experience in Maine. We know we’re all going to take care of each other.” Consider Eric and Liz Smith, who moved to Phippsburg from the Philadelphia suburbs in 2017. Eric’s family had vacationed near Ellsworth when he was a kid, and Liz, who grew up in the Boston suburbs, had spent time in Blue Hill. When they started looking for a place where they could have a more outdoorsy lifestyle with a slower pace, Maine was a natural choice — especially once Eric landed an IT job at L.L.Bean (Liz was already working remotely). In just four years, they’ve had a baby, moved to Brunswick, switched jobs, and discovered a community of people who treasure time in nature as much as they do. “We walk, we bike on the town commons, we meet up with friends from our son’s daycare on trails that are just 10 minutes away,” Liz says. Adds Eric, “It’s certainly something we don’t take for granted.” When Nate Colpitts learned that The Ecology School was offering a weeklong Eco-Adventure day camp last summer, he was eager to send his eight-year-old son, Calvin. “It’s so important that my son develops a love for the outdoors and a desire to care for the environment,” the Saco resident says. Taking care of the environment is “the number-one issue his generation and ours will face.” When Calvin returned from camp and informed his dad that “all creatures deserve to live the course of their lives naturally, from the smallest insect to the largest mammal,” Nate considered his mission accomplished. “They’re bringing energy to such important topics,” Nate says. Summer 2022 marks the first season The Ecology School will transition its day-camp program — which usually fills up within a few weeks of opening registration — to a full overnight camp. The magic of nature that kids experience each summer will be unique and transformative, breaking down big topics like sustainability, climate change, and farming into entertaining, educational activities that kids can enjoy at camp and take action on at home. Campers will have 105 acres of forests, farm fields, ponds, and more to explore at The Ecology School’s new River Bend Farm campus, located on the Saco River. The campus has two new buildings, models of sustainability that are built to meet the world’s most rigorous green building standards. Solar panels on-site generate energy. Rain gardens capture stormwater runoff so it can be reused to water the gardens and fields. A five-acre farm grows vegetables that are used in campers’ daily meals. “We’re giving kids an opportunity to come here and acquire the tools to understand adult topics like climate change, but also have fun and really engage in learning about the world so they understand their place in it and the role they can play to help protect it,” director of programs Alex Grindle says. Much of the benefit campers get, she adds, comes from getting away from screens and their everyday environments and exploring The Ecology School grounds — romping through the meadows, marveling at the snails and the slugs on the riverbank, and spending time in the forest. “Kids have a natural desire to be connected to the world around them — it’s embedded in all of us,” Grindle says. “It’s really powerful to see those connections really flourish here.” In addition to camps, The Ecology School has a robust overnight program for schools, professional development for teachers, agricultural workshops for adults, and now, with the opening of River Bend Farm, a rentable space for groups inspired to experience true sustainable living. Since the organization opened in 1998, it has hosted 187,000 kids and adults from all over the country to learn about sustainability, conservation, and connections between people, plants, and animals. In the tiny midcoast town of Bremen, the working waterfront is the beating heart of the community. On an inlet where the Medomak River meets Muscongus Bay, the Bremen Lobster Pound Co-Op has operated for nearly a century, a base for local fishermen and a cultural touchstone for the town’s 800 residents. But five years ago, the future of the working waterfront was uncertain; its aging infrastructure was in need of an upgrade, and many longtime co-op members wanted to retire. With skyrocketing real-estate values and looming questions about what impact regulations and warming waters would have on lobstering, many worried that the waterfront would be converted to a different use and that Bremen would lose its treasured center of gravity. “If the working waterfront were to go away, jobs would go away for people whose families have been making a living on the water for generations,” says town selectman Boe Marsh, who has operated a lobster, clam, and shrimp dealership in Bremen since 2010. “A big part of the spirit of the community would be lost.” Marsh’s company, Community Shellfish, bought the Bremen Lobster Pound Co-Op in 2017 and added new holding tanks, bait storage, and other essential infrastructure for lobster harvesting and processing. In two former lobster pounds, he set up aquaculture for oysters and clams. Today, Community Shellfish employs 27 people and buys lobster from 35 fishermen, as well as clams from 100 harvesters. A number of local lobstermen have started cultivating oysters, seaweed, and kelp to augment their fishing incomes. To launch the aquaculture operations, Marsh got a vital assist from the Island Institute. The Rockland-based community-development nonprofit consulted with Marsh, helping him identify and apply for grants, tap into other financing opportunities, and connect with researchers at the University of Maine. “The Island Institute was a true partner,” Marsh says. “They helped me not just preserve the waterfront but dynamize it.” The assistance is just one of the myriad ways that the Island Institute works with residents in coastal and year-round island communities to tackle economic challenges. The Institute trained and continues to support dozens of fishermen in kelp and shellfish farming. In addition, the organization offers professional development, targeted investment, and networking to help small businesses along the coast. Its longstanding Island Fellows program also builds critical capacity in small towns for community-based projects in education, government, and health care. To hear Island Institute senior community development officer Sam Belknap tell it, the nonprofit’s work to fortify working waterfronts has never been more important. “Working waterfronts represent this critical intersection between the ocean and the economy, and they’re incredibly vulnerable,” he says. “It’s not just about preserving jobs or the operations on the shoreline, it’s about ensuring that these coastal communities and their economies are as resilient as possible to all the changes we’re seeing all along the coast.” After Barbara Atherton moved to West Bath from the DC area in 2011, she quickly became a regular at open-mic nights at 317 Main Community Music Center, in Yarmouth. “She kept coming home and saying, ‘You’ve got to see this place — it’s just alive with people,’” her husband, Jim, recalls. Before long, both Athertons were students at 317 Main. Barbara, who played the fiddle, started mandolin lessons, and Jim, who played electric bass, began learning the upright bass. They both joined Unspent Youth, an ensemble of retirees who meet weekly with a 317 teaching artist and who perform on a regular basis. “If you love music, you have to go for it,” Barbara says. “The instructors are good at meeting you where you are and going from there.” The Athertons are two of more than 25,000 people, ranging from toddlers to octogenarians, who’ve taken lessons, joined ensembles, attended summer camps, festivals, concerts, and jam sessions at 317 Main, many of them traveling as far as 50 miles to do so. Through its grant-funded community partnership programs, the nonprofit also works with schools, senior centers, and other community organizations to offer free music lessons, performances, and workshops to people who wouldn’t otherwise have access. Demand for 317’s programs has grown exponentially since its founding in 2004 and only accelerated during the pandemic as 317 has expanded remote offerings. Now more than ever, people are hungering for music, with its power to comfort, nurture, connect, and build community, 317 Main executive director John Williams says. “Music is the catalyst — and we offer quality music programming that is geared to meet each individual where they are in their musical journey,” Williams says. “But the idea is really to create a fun, stress-free, engaging environment.” 317 Main is now working to raise $4 million to renovate and expand its facility, a restored 1855 Italianate home on Yarmouth’s Main Street, to meet growing demand and facilitate future growth. Their Raise the Barn campaign will fund a recording studio and music lab, 11 new soundproof lesson rooms, a 200-seat multipurpose performance space, and other community spaces to encourage connection. That’s music to the ears of folks like professional pianist David Bartoletti, whose five-year-old daughter, Maddelina, participated in one of 317’s weeklong summer camps. She loved it so much that they enrolled in a Little Roots class, which introduces young kids to ukulele, fiddle, and piano during a 13-week session. “Camp was a really great stepping stone — to be in an easy, fun, happy environment and practice making friends,” Bartoletti, of New Gloucester, says. “317 is a community where so many different wonderful things can happen.” Since Ryan Conery-Poulin moved to Maine nearly a decade ago, Little Whaleboat Island has provided a natural escape for him and his family. Conery-Poulin has spent many a summer afternoon with his wife and three kids out on the island, probing tide pools, clambering up rocky ledges, exploring the forest of century-old oaks, and savoring the sensation of being on a remote island, despite it being just five miles from the Freeport town dock. He treasures the memories they’ve made watching bald-eagle fledglings learn to fly, walking across the sandbars to Tuck and Nate islands at low tide, and discovering the fragrant sea lavender that grows in the island’s meadow. “There’s always a sense of discovery and adventure whenever we go to Little Whaleboat,” says Conery-Poulin, who is head of tasting-room operations for Maine Beer Company, in Freeport. On Little Whaleboat Island, “We’re able to leave the world behind, de-stress, and just enjoy spending time together. We’re so grateful to have places like this.” For decades, families like the Conery-Poulins have been able to enjoy Little Whaleboat because its owner has welcomed the public to come ashore. Now, the owner is ready to sell, and Maine Coast Heritage Trust is working to raise $1.3 million to buy the 22-acre island and ensure that it remains undeveloped and open to the public forever. The work is part of MCHT’s sweeping effort to protect Maine’s coast. Already, the land trust has conserved 156,000 acres of coastal land from Kittery to Lubec and created 148 preserves free and open to the public. For MCHT, the Little Whaleboat Project represents a rare opportunity to secure a wild place in the heart of southern Maine, which is the most populated and developed part of the state. As Casco Bay’s popularity increases, project manager Keith Fletcher says, it’s important to protect unspoiled natural places where people can find solitude and to ensure that animals, plants, and nesting birds, as well as the waters and marine ecosystems, will be protected from development. “Privately owned islands rarely go up for sale,” Fletcher says, “So whenever there is an opportunity to protect an island that provides scenic, recreational, and ecological value, it’s important that we take it.” MCHT got a big lift in conserving Little Whaleboat from Maine Beer Company, which donated $50,000 to the campaign earlier this year. “These islands are real treasures,” Maine Beer Company co-owner Daniel Kleban says. “It’s easy to forget how fortunate we are in Maine to have places like this that are just so close to shore and yet feel totally remote and so peaceful. It takes effort from organizations and people who are in a position to help to conserve places like this.” The support for Little Whaleboat is just one of a multitude of social-responsibility initiatives that Kleban and his brother David have rolled out since they launched Maine Beer Company in 2009. The company installed solar panels on its Freeport campus, which offset more than half the energy the brewery and tasting room use. By 2030, the company wants to generate enough renewable energy to offset every watt of electricity it consumes. As a member of 1% for the Planet, Maine Beer donates 1 percent of its gross annual sales to environmental causes. Maine Beer Company’s support for the Little Whaleboat project is about more than just helping MCHT reach the fundraising target, Kleban says. He hopes to raise awareness about MCHT’s work and to inspire Maine Beer Company fans to make a similar commitment to causes they are passionate about, giving what they are able to, whether that’s volunteer time or financial support. “We want to lead by example and show that you don’t have to be the richest person or the biggest company in the world in order to make the world a better place,” Kleban says. “A bunch of people doing really small things can add up and have a huge and lasting impact. By using this megaphone that we have, our hope is that we’ll show others what’s possible.” When asked to describe what makes the Kents Hill School experience unique, Jackson Melendy thinks about the multicultural-literature class he took during his junior year. He read books like A Long Way Gone: Memoirs of a Boy Soldier and had in-depth discussions about issues like civil war, migration, and poverty, examining how the story relates to events happening around the world right now. “Class wasn’t just about reading books, learning grammar, and memorizing information,” says Melendy, a senior. “It was about using the texts to learn about the world and understand it better.” Whenever Melendy didn’t understand something, he always felt like he could reach out for guidance. With classes that have as few as four students, “it’s easy to really connect with your teachers,” he says. “They’re very open to taking the time to provide whatever help you need.” Melendy’s experience reflects a large part of what Kents Hill School, located in Readfield, Maine, is trying to do for its 200 day and boarding students in grades nine through 12 and for those taking a postgraduate year. Teachers work to foster critical thinking, creativity, collaboration, and communication in the classroom and beyond, which will serve students long after they graduate. “We need to prepare our students to do more than take tests,” head of school Chris Cheney says. “We’re providing an all-around education for young people that prepares them for anything.” That all-around ethos informs Kents Hill’s approach to everything from its activity requirements (students must play a sport or participate in an extracurricular activity each season) to its class offerings. In addition to standard courses like chemistry and algebra, students can choose to explore astrophysics, furniture making, global public health, and the social and political history of hip-hop. All classes include projects that give students a chance to apply their knowledge in practical ways. Students in last year’s Community Design and Build class, for example, built an 18-part story walk for the Readfield Community Library. Over the course of a semester, they worked in teams, developed prototypes, and did all the construction themselves. “It was a real-world experience, building, collaborating, and doing community service,” Cheney says. “We try to find opportunities for kids to solve bigger problems in tangible ways.” Equally important, says Dean of Enrollment Management and Director of Financial Aid Alison Lincoln-Rich, is providing students with a sense of belonging and a community on campus that brings socioeconomic diversity that reflects the actual world. Kents Hill students hailfrom 26 countries and 19 states, and more than half of these students receive financial aid. students attend Kents Hill of students receive financial aid of students arefrom Maine states are represented in the student body countries are represented in the student body “In high school, students are developing their own sense of self, and we work hard to help them embrace who they are and what is important to them,” Lincoln-Rich says. That feeling of belonging is a huge part of what senior Naeema O’Rourke has valued about her experience at Kents Hill. As the only person of color at the elementary and middle school in her hometown of Wayne, Maine, she often felt like she was distancing herself from her Indonesian heritage, and she was hesitant to disclose her Muslim faith. But at Kents Hill, where she has friends from Japan, Sweden, China, and Spain, among other places, she feels free to be herself. “It’s so refreshing to have this little world of diverse cultures in Maine,” O’Rourke says. She also appreciates the opportunity to build skills and pursue interests that she’ll draw on in the years ahead. A class on Western civilization stoked her interest in world history and has inspired her interest in a career in international relations. She has always loved to ski, but at Kents Hill she gets the opportunity to play soccer and tennis and has learned how much she enjoys those sports too. After serving as student-council president and a tour guide for prospective students, she has gained confidence in a leadership role and in speaking in front of large groups of people. “Here at Kents Hill,” she says, “I’ve gotten a real opportunity to see what I can do.” For decades, Maine has experienced higher rates of food insecurity than most other states in the nation. Before the pandemic hit, one in five Mainers did not have consistent access to enough nutritious food for an active, healthy life. When COVID-19 swept the globe in 2020 and thousands of jobs disappeared, the hunger crisis escalated. In addition to the families experiencing hunger before the pandemic, some families found themselves on the verge of financial instability for the first time due to COVID-19 and began turning to community food pantries to support their basic needs. Staff and volunteers at Maine’s Good Shepherd Food Bank saw the effects firsthand. “During the pandemic, hunger was touching more lives, and it became more visible,” vice president of development and communications Erin Fogg says. As the recovery from COVID-19 continues, an estimated 40 million meals will be needed in Maine in the coming year. Good Shepherd Food Bank, Maine’s largest hunger-relief organization, is working to meet that need through its Campaign to End Hunger, a sweeping effort to raise $250 million in large-scale food donations and philanthropic contributions to ensure that, by 2025, every Mainer has access to the food they need to thrive. Mainers face foodinsecurity, meaning they don’t have consistent access to enough food for an active, healthy life. That includes 50,000 children partner agencies —including food pantries, meal sites, shelters, senior centers, schools, and health centers — distribute food from Good Shepherd Food Bank to Mainers in need pounds of fresh, Maine-grown food are distributed annually by the 80 farmers who partner with the Food Bank’s Mainers Feeding Mainers program meals were distributed by Good Shepherd Food Bankin the last calendar year,up 25 percent fromthe year before meals are estimated tobe needed from thecharitable food networkin the coming year is being raised by GoodShepherd Food Bank to ensure that, by 2025, every Mainer has access to the food they need to thrive The statewide organization is also working on long-term solutions to eliminate barriers that perpetuate food insecurity by championing public policies that improve access to healthy food, innovating new methods of distributing food, and working to address inequities for communities of color, which are disproportionately affected by hunger. Above all, Good Shepherd Food Bank is working to keep the crisis in the public eye. “It’s a quiet epidemic, and everyone thinks it only affects people they don’t know,” Fogg says. “But hunger is a real and everyday problem, and it impacts every community in Maine.” Pulling into downtown Milbridge from the stark, windswept barrens of down east Maine, an unexpected sight appears on a pasture overlooking Narraguagus Bay: dozens of neat-as-a-pin rows of lettuce, tomatoes, broccoli, peas, and seemingly any other vegetable, herb, and flower one could imagine. The bounty is there — and free for the taking — thanks to Women for Healthy Rural Living, a 17-year-old nonprofit organization based just across the street. Nurse practitioner Chris Kuhni founded the organization, initially known as the Women’s Health Resource Library, in 2004, providing books and videos to help women in and around Milbridge better navigate conditions like diabetes, menopause, and osteoporosis. The library quickly blossomed into a community center with a wide range of programs, including support groups, toddler playgroups, and Weight Watchers meetings, as well as Bone Builders classes to help older adults reverse the effects of osteoporosis. “We just kept evolving to respond to meet the local needs,” Kuhni says. Access to nutritious foods quickly emerged as a major need. Washington County has the highest rate of hunger in the state and has among the highest rates of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and high cholesterol in the nation. “My patients understood that their diets were not good, but they just couldn’t afford healthy food,” Kuhni says. “Many of them were working multiple jobs, and there just weren’t places where they felt comfortable going for a walk.” The free pick-your-own garden project, called Incredible Edible Milbridge, started with a few planters and then, thanks to land donations and conservation efforts, quickly expanded. Today, 8,000 pounds of organic vegetables are harvested from the 18,000-square-foot plot in Milbridge Commons Wellness Park and a 15,000-square-foot plot at the nearby Red Barn Hotel. Through the gardens and its ever-expanding slate of programs, WHRL reaches more than 4,000 people a year, with just two employees, a 10-member board, and roughly 50 volunteers, including Kuhni, who serves as the unpaid executive director. From the beginning, WHRL has counted on support from Wyman’s, the Milbridge-based wild-blueberry grower and processor. Over the years, the company has provided essential financial support for the organization, along with contributions of everything from greenhouses to building materials. When WHRL moved into a new headquarters earlier this year, more than 100 Wyman’s employees helped rehab the building as part of a company-wide community-service day called Wildly Better Days. Support for WHRL and other nonprofits, — like the Maine Seacoast Mission, Nature Conservancy, and Maine Community Foundation — is a natural extension of the company’s commitment to sustainability, according to Wyman’s senior director of human resources April Norton. “One of our greatest resources is our employees, and improving their health and welfare and their rural communities is a large part of that,” Norton says. “WHRL provides critical services to meet so many health needs, and we want to support that however we can.”",neutral,seaweed aquaculture,2021,Maine
45,9668,Your Breakfast Smoothie Needs More Kelp | Down East Magazine,"Atlantic Sea Farms’ seaweed cubes are good for you and for the environment. In 2019, 14 sea farmers along the Maine coast raised 250,000 pounds of rope-grown kelp for Atlantic Sea Farms. Now, 27 farmers — mostly lobstermen looking to diversify — harvest about a million pounds a year for the Biddeford company to turn into shredded kelp, kelp kimchee, kelp sauerkraut, fermented kelp salad, and frozen cubes of pureed kelp. At first, the frozen cubes only came in pure kelp form, an umami addition to sauces, soups, and smoothies. A few months ago, two new smoothie-friendly kelp cubes joined the lineup: One adds cranberries from Massachusetts-based juice maker Ocean Spray. The other, blueberry ginger, uses wild Maine blueberries from Milbridge-based Wyman’s. Seaweed smoothies are good for you and for the environment: Farmed kelp sequesters carbon and requires little in the way of inputs or maintenance — just motoring out to check on the lines from time to time. And between the kelp and berries, that’s a lot of fiber, omega-3 fatty acids, essential amino acids, vitamins, and minerals. It’s a sort of herbivorous surf and turf, mighty refreshing on a hot summer day.",neutral,seaweed aquaculture,2022,Maine
46,9675,Moving to Maine: What to Know | Down East Magazine,"Let’s face it: Maine’s not like anyplace else, and we like it that way. But if you’re considering moving here, it can be an adjustment. We reached out to four smart Mainers whose professional lives revolve around new arrivals, and we asked them: what have you learned that every prospective Mainer needs to hear' Katie Shorey was visiting family in Sweden, in Oxford County, when she saw a TV ad for a start-up conference and decided, on a whim, to volunteer there. “My mom was a nurse. My dad was a forest ranger. I had no concept of the industries in Maine,” she says. Connecting with other attendees changed Shorey’s perspective on what was possible in her home state, spurring her decision to move back. In 2018, she became president of the organization that sponsored the conference, now called Startup Maine, and in 2019, she joined Live and Work in Maine, a nonprofit initiative to match would-be residents to careers in the Pine Tree State. “I’m the poster child,” she says. I have lived in DC, San Francisco, and Chicago. And something that sticks out for me is that Maine is very relationship-oriented, not transactional. I love that. Anyone will take a coffee meeting with you. It is easy to access leaders all across the state. When you think about building your career or growing your career, people in all different industries want to help you. They’re happy to lend you 15 to 20 minutes of their time. We recently launched a series called “Welcome Home.” We had 19 networking events across the state, from Machias to Presque Isle to Bridgton and everywhere in between. You could be a longtime Mainer, you could have boomeranged back to Maine, or you could be brand-new to Maine — the idea is to help people find their people because that helps with retention. There are plenty of ways to build your network. Mainers take care of their own, and we also take care of our communities. There is a spot for you, and there are people for you. There’s still awareness building that needs to be done around the industries in Maine. It’s not just lobstermen, potatoes, and lighthouses. We have a burgeoning tech scene. We have more than 450 life-science companies. And while Maine might be known for its traditional industries of farming, fishing, and forestry, we’ve now seen the intersection of technology in these sectors, which is helping Maine lead the way in sustainability and solving global problems here at home. We are pioneers with things like nanocellulose and aquaculture. They’re using seaweed to sequester CO2 from the atmosphere by putting sequestering kelp on the ocean floor. And we have farm robots! Plus veterinary health, veterinary tech, health-care manufacturing, 3D printing, and rocket companies. You don’t have to just work remotely. We want you to work for a Maine company. An associate broker with United Country Lifestyle Properties of Maine, Carmen McPhail has lived in Maine all her life (okay, except for a year of college). Originally from Presque Isle, she now lives in Lincoln and says the best part of being in Maine is the state’s diverse opportunities. An hour north of home, she can climb mountains; two hours east and she’s either on the coast or in Canada. When she wants to go skiing, she heads a couple hours west, and it’s two hours south to take advantage of arts and entertainment in Maine’s bigger cities. “You just need to figure out which part of Maine you want to live in,” she says. “Because you still get to do all the other things.” The most important thing to know is that Maine is a large state and offers lots of diverse experiences. Do a little research and pick a region or two that fit your wants, needs, and lifestyle before you decide to move here. Being in Aroostook County is way different than being in York County. Being on the coast is way different than being in the mountains. Most people who move to Maine move here for our lifestyle. Figure out where you want to be for your lifestyle.  Be prepared for our weather. You can have fun in the rain at noon, then it can snow overnight, and that can be eight of the 12 months where I live! Be prepared for our wildlife. If you are in the mountains or outside of the cities, you can run into a moose in the road. Be prepared for navigation. You know that saying, “You can’t get there from here'” Well, you can. But you need to know that we usually measure distances in time instead of in miles. I like to ask buyers when I talk to them for the first time, have you ever been to Maine' Do you know what our weather’s like' Do you understand that there’s no straight road to get from here to there unless you’re on I-95' And even that’s not really straight. Finally, use a Realtor. We can make a real difference in your home-buying experience. We educate our buyers about the local market conditions, whether there’s a good inventory of for-sale properties, what the housing values are, how to deal with financing, and the long-term advantages of homeownership. We’re specialists in our own markets. In the mid-’80s, a diplomat at the U.S. Embassy gave Reza Jalali, then fleeing Iran, a book about the U.S. Jalali saw Maine’s beauty and thought it looked like paradise. “Mind you, all the pictures were taken during the summertime,” he says with a laugh. “To this day, I maintain there should have been a disclosure!” While Jalali’s first February stateside made him question his choice, he came to love Maine, largely, he says, because of the safety and sense of dignity he found here, along with the chance to be himself. Now, Jalali takes pride in helping other new Mainers get acclimated. “Part of what I do every day is to repay that debt,” he says. When talking to both highly professional immigrants and also those who come as asylum seekers or refugees, my answer remains the same. Maine is safe. Each of us, of course, get to define safety in our own ways, but this is basic safety: a sense of security. Every now and then, an immigrant reminds me that when they watch the local news, there are no reports of shootings in the first four or five highlights. That reinforces my sense that we live in a magical place. The same thing is true with the displaced people of the world. In their case, safety is actually more important than food. Imagine you are here from Angola or El Salvador, and you’re fleeing gang violence and political turmoil. Many Mainers continue to be confused why so many asylum seekers want to come to Maine. Safety and to really feel secure.  The second is schools. I worked for the University of Southern Maine for 19 years, and I’ve traveled a lot. Our school system is amazing. We don’t have high schools across the state with 4,000 or 5,000 students. We don’t have schools where they check you for guns and things like that. And that’s the norm in many places. We have a really good education system in terms of teachers who care and communities that really care, meaning people show up at meetings. So schooling, to me, is a huge attraction. And then we come to the natural beauty. Many native-born Mainers assume that immigrants don’t care about natural beauty. That is inaccurate. There are many immigrants who are in Maine because of its natural beauty. Maine has gorgeous lakes, the clean ocean, not-so-crowded beaches, and fantastic hiking and skiing opportunities. And it’s affordable to enjoy the beauty. Living in a community like Portland, where it is 15 minutes of driving time to the beach or 20 minutes to a place you can hike' That is unusual. In other states, you need a lot of money to live close to a gorgeous place. We don’t have to drive two hours to make it to a place to enjoy the day.  By age 17, Rhiannon Hampson, a native of rural down east Maine, was eager to explore “the big city.” She bought a one-way bus ticket to Seattle and, after living there for a bit, traveled extensively, spending time in a few other states. But by her mid-20s, she realized there was no place like home. Now, in her role at USDA Rural Development, Hampson is able to share her love of the state with potential new Mainers. Sometimes she quotes an Emily Dickinson poem she grew up hearing from her mother, an English professor. “I see New Englandly,” Hampson says. “This is home.” I tell people all the time, Maine needs warm bodies. We have 1.3 million people, and we enjoy it — it’s lovely that we have more trees than people — but we’re aging. I want to dispel the myth that, as Mainers, we’re like, “You’re from away' We don’t want you.” That’s not true. I want people to come here. And I want people to want to be here. This is not a place that you end up in by default. You don’t accidentally find yourself moving toward the Canadian border and the Atlantic Ocean. People are purposeful when they come here. As an agency, we are trying to make sure that people feel welcome.  Two is that we are more sophisticated than people might imagine. There are a lot of tropes about Maine in the media. And I think, as Mainers, we tend to subscribe to those tropes. But the fact is, we are an innovative space. And we have the luxury, honestly, because we have a small population, to have a really robust support system for that innovation. I don’t want people to think that if they have some kind of high skill level that they wouldn’t belong here or that they wouldn’t find support for their work here. At the same time, we still maintain that rural culture. You can still find a bean supper and have those kinds of small community connections that are very place based. Sometimes when people think about moving to Maine, they think, “I need quality health care, I need educational resources, or I need a good school for my kids, so I’m going to stay south of Lewiston–Auburn.” I really want people to know that a whole of Maine exists north of Lewiston–Auburn. We have pockets of Hancock and Washington and Aroostook and Piscataquis counties that are vibrant. Moving to Maine is an adventure. You’re coming to the easternmost point of the United States! We’re not Canada, but we can see it from here. We have this kind of frontier feeling about ourselves. I want people to think of that as a chance to bring their skills. Rural spaces are not to be feared. That’s a real opportunity for people.",neutral,seaweed aquaculture,2023,Maine
47,9677,Island Institute Helps Families Cast a Wider Net | Down East Magazine,"On Little Cranberry Island, and in Maine’s other island and coastal communities, the nonprofit helps families diversify their income — and a secure fishing future. In 2019, Sam Flavin moved to Maine from Burlington, Massachusetts, to take a job as a sternman on a lobsterboat. “I’d never really considered making a life on the water,” the former nonprofit worker says. “I just decided to make a switch, and it immediately became clear it was a good fit.” The boat, Emma Marie, was moored off Little Cranberry Island, also known as Islesford, off Mount Desert Island. “That’s how I got my start in the industry,” Flavin says, “and how I met Emma.” The captain’s daughter, Emma Fernald also worked aboard her namesake boat, the seventh generation of her family to fish from Islesford Harbor.  Today, Flavin and Fernald live together on Little Cranberry, part of a year-round population of 71 (“We just counted the other day,” Fernald says). Nearly all of their neighbors are somehow involved in the lobstering community, which spans generations, from licensed fishermen as young as 10 right on up to veteran haulers in their 80s. Flavin and Fernald love the work, demanding as it is. “You live your whole life around fishing,” Flavin says. “It dominates your schedule.” But it’s also seasonal and can be capricious, which is why each of them have projects in the works to help diversify their income, with a little help from Island Institute, a community development nonprofit based in Rockland. Fernald, who’s 25, is still a sternwoman on her dad’s lobsterboat, but she’s also in the process of starting a small scallop farm. Last year, she secured two Island Institute grants to help get it off the ground: a Compass Workforce Grant, part of an Institute program geared towards young adults launching new careers, and a Business Resilience Grant. Fernald used the money to buy startup gear: spat bags to collect larvae, anchors, floatation buoys, and more. “There’s a lot of up-front costs involved with starting an aquaculture farm, and it takes a long time to get a return on your investment,” she says. “These grant programs, for me, are essential to being able to get this farm up and running.”  Flavin, meanwhile, has moved on to another lobsterboat, but he also moonlights as a scuba diver, doing mooring maintenance and inspections, removing ropes from boat propellers, and working with aquaculture farmers. He too was awarded a Compass Workforce Grant, which he used to buy a dry suit for winter diving, and he’s since applied for a Business Resilience Grant, hoping to put the money towards a boat. “That would basically allow me to have a fully functioning business,” he says. In the last decade, Island Institute has invested some $600,000 in small businesses just like these. Grants and loans from the Institute have allowed a Swan’s Island resident to increase her family’s income by growing seaweed, helped expand a coffee-roaster business on Monhegan, provided capital to launch a kelp-based skincare line out of York, and more. For Island Institute, currently celebrating its 40th anniversary, it’s just one part of a broader commitment to community development in Maine’s coastal towns and 15 unbridged-island communities.  From its founding in 1983, the Institute has celebrated and helped to sustain Maine island life in a variety of ways. One of the Institute’s earliest efforts was to help strengthen island schools by offering student scholarships for off-island learning, hosting gatherings for island teachers to help combat isolation, and providing professional development opportunities. In 2000, the organization launched its Island Fellows Program, placing recent higher-education graduates in positions serving community needs, from digitizing historical archives to working on climate-action committees. The Island Institute’s 2005 study found that Maine’s working waterfront makes up only 20 miles of more than 5,000 miles of coastline — and that number is in decline. In the decades since, preserving the working waterfront has remained a top priority for the organization, as evidenced most recently by its support of Maine Legislature Bill LD 574, which will allow land trusts to conserve working waterfront — preventing, for example, its conversion to condos. The Institute also supports the creative economy through Archipelago, a Rockland store dedicated to Maine-made goods. It led the charge to connect islands and coastal communities to high-speed internet, and it birthed the Maine Island Trail, which now operates as its own nonprofit. All of these initiatives connect back to the organization’s top priorities of addressing climate issues, building resilient economies, and fostering strong leadership. “Maine’s island and coastal communities are facing unprecedented changes,” says Island Institute president Kim Hamilton. “Our biggest challenge is ensuring we are using our resources to support communities at the point of highest leverage.” Flavin and Fernald don’t plan to quit lobstering anytime soon, despite the challenges that a warming Gulf of Maine and evolving federal regulations on gear and closures may pose for the industry. “We definitely have concerns, but Sam and I both think it’s important to keep a positive attitude,” Fernald says. Flavin agrees. “Fishermen are able to work together, especially under stress, to come up with really good solutions,” he says. “We’ve got some big challenges, but I think we are uniquely positioned to be able to tackle them — it’s the nature of the way we work and the way we live.”  The extra financial security from their new businesses, both say, helps make it possible to keep on fishing, both in the off-season (the Emma Marie hauls out in the winter, while Flavin’s new boat fishes just twice a week) and during stretches of low prices, meager landings, or other disruptions. “In fishing, there’s an ebb and flow,” Flavin says. “It’s good to hedge our bets a little bit.” Fernald’s family has fished off Little Cranberry since long before the founding of the Island Institute, but the organization hopes to be a resource for generations to come for hers and other island families looking to maintain their way of life. “We will continue to use our resources, talent, and relationships to support the work of island and coastal communities,” Hamilton says. “Our vision is deeply connected to their own vision for a sustainable, vibrant future.”",good,seaweed aquaculture,2023,Maine
48,9678,"\""The Long Arc of Maine’s Coastal Economy,\"" by Philip Conkling | Down East Magazine","As lobsters move farther offshore, what industries will support Maine’s coastal economies in the future' In the photo that photographer Peter Ralston calls “Front,” an approaching storm encroaches the Deer Island Thorofare Light, on Mark Island, off Stonington. The deeply indented Maine coastline — sliced through by dozens of rivers large and small, bathed by vigorous tides that traverse a complex variety of bottom substrates — presents an astoundingly diverse set of habitats for our coastal and offshore fisheries. More than 52 commercial species of fish, shellfish, worms, and seaweed are harvested here, with boats fishing out of more than a hundred harbors along Maine’s 5,000 miles of saltwater frontage. Today, they’re a proud and defining characteristic of the coast, but Maine’s fisheries haven’t always been the dominant coastal activity. Until the beginning of the 20th century, lumber exports were the primary drivers of coastal wealth, with wooden shipbuilding also lucrative. Valuable cargoes of lime, granite, and ice were shipped from dozens of Maine’s harbors, adding to the coast’s economic diversity. Beginning in the 1920s, an efficient new method of trawling with large nets greatly increased catches of cod, haddock, pollock, and hake, continuing until these resources were essentially exhausted from overfishing, by the 1980s. But, providentially, just as groundfish fleets were decimated, Maine’s lobster catch began increasing substantially — both in volume and value. Over the course of the last four decades, lobstering has become the economic underpinning for coastal communities from Kittery to Eastport. No one knows whether the rapidly warming waters of the Gulf of Maine will spell the end of this era, when the lobster fishery dominated the Maine coast, but we do know that warming waters have resulted in the fishery’s collapse throughout southern New England. Lobster harvests have also declined along the southern Maine coast, while the center of lobster distribution has moved farther north and east. The ecological diversity of the Gulf of Maine suggests there will always be marine resources of one species or another, new ways for us to take advantage of the legendary productivity of these waters. But it’s also likely that, in the future, more businesses along Maine’s working waterfronts will look to the potential of other resources. In addition to its lobsters, the Gulf of Maine is a world-class wind resource. Senator Angus King once called it the “Saudi Arabia of wind.” Offshore wind developers, however, have struggled with the myriad technical challenges of developing floating platforms for Maine’s deep waters. The industry, if we can even call it that, has faced the further challenge of attracting deep-pocketed partners to invest the hundreds of millions required to finance the initial stages of development. Perhaps most dauntingly, offshore-wind proponents have confronted an increasingly bitter opposition from lobster harvesters. Part of the passionate opposition of lobstermen to offshore wind results from the locus of lobster harvesting shifting from inshore to offshore waters. Offshore lobstering requires bigger boats, bigger gear, and higher risks for more reward. The collision between these interests is perhaps unavoidable. But to me, it is also sad. There’s such potential for Maine’s multiple maritime traditions, its men and women wedded to the sea, to play valuable roles in developing the industries of the future. Whether or not Mainers can agree if it’s in our best interests to welcome new offshore industries, one thing we know is that, for good and for ill, the winds will continue to blow.",neutral,seaweed aquaculture,2023,Maine
49,9681,Fishing in Public | The Bollard,"Hey folks! It’s nice to be back after my short hiatus. A minor infection was all it was this time. I’m back on track now, by Jingo! In my last column, I wrote a lot about the decimation of our waterfront, what with the last bait-and-tackle shop moving off the peninsula. Well, after a long, long think, I’ve got to say that maybe things might not be quite as dismal as I made it sound. As we all know, fishing policy was pretty simple for centuries: there’s the ocean, go get the fish! That’s changed in the last few decades, but there’s also been a change in direction. I say the number one way to keep the waterfront alive is aquaculture. I think farming the ocean is the key to money-making on the waterfront these days. I wonder why fish farms seem to be so much more productive in places other than Maine. Hell, we got nice water! A little chilly, of course, but real clean and nutritional. Gee willikers, look at all the species that come here to visit! I really do believe now is the time for us to look into the idea of raising fish. We probably have the talent for this scheme already. If the University of Maine teamed up with local fishermen and chipped in some seed money, who knows where it could lead' I could be back on the Maine State Pier fishing my heart away. Plus, farmed fish induces the wild fellas to greatly increase in value. Let’s also not forget the ocean foliage. The Japanese have been eating seaweed for millennia, and we’ve been harvesting rockweed for some time now, using it as an additive, a derivative, medicine — you name it. I got a real strong feeling there’s many more uses to be discovered. Come on, you grads, undergrads, brainy mothers — let’s get to it! And I’m thinking plankton’s got potential, too. Even the tiniest things in the sea have much value. Another thought I had: Whatever happened to desalinization' I don’t hear much about it at all lately, but boy, if ever there was a time we needed fresh water, this is surely it. For a while it was a huge, promising development. Can you imagine a world where every person everywhere is provided with an adequate water supply' Damn, let’s get to it! ’Specially for them poor folks in Puerto Rico right now. Then there’s other possible money-makers, like the capital T: Tourism. I’m very sorry to say this to you folks that don’t care for folks “from away,” but boy, that’s where the money’s at. This ain’t really my cup of tea, but I can think of a few ideas to lure ’em in. I’d bet my bottom dollar a lot of visitors would just love to see how a fishing boat works, and a real lobster-boat trip would be the highlight of anyone’s visit. The fishermen make a few bucks, the tourists are happy — everyone wins! And how about the fact we’re the closest deep-water American port to Europe' Let’s get out the word on that, OK, folks' It seems to me that alone must be worth a few bucks, right' Hey, we live in the bestest city in the USA, and if people work together, put their dough in the right place, things could be just swell. And to the boys and girls in Augusta — please, for the love of Jesus, stay the fuck out of things! Instead of chopping us off at the knees, try and think about progress. Think of how to help out all the poor folks getting kicked in the nuts by the lack of seafood. I’ve seen them Asian, African and European factory ships scooping up all the fish, and I don’t believe we’ll ever fully recover from that. But I truly believe we can uncover more secrets of the ocean and discover new ways to make money, like with new medicines. We need more serious research. You with me, kids' We’ve been nailed before and we’ll get nailed again, but if anyone can roll with the punches, it’s us. And it ain’t over till it’s over.",neutral,seaweed aquaculture,2017,Maine
50,9705,Mussel Men - The Maine Mag,"For years, Matthew Moretti would tell people he worked as a “professional shoveler.” Before his family business upgraded its equipment two years ago, Matthew explains, wielding a shovel was integral to the mussel farming process. “The original way we harvested at the barge was that we would haul the lines up over the side, and we had this way of stripping them that was very primitive,” he says. “For the first six years of the company, we would knock the mussels off by whacking the lines with a shovel. The mussels would pound down onto the deck, making a huge mess, mud flying everywhere.” Much has changed since 2010, when Matthew and his father, Gary Moretti, purchased Bangs Island Mussels. The father-and-son duo wanted to invest in sustainable aquaculture, and although the company was “tiny” when they bought it (“it was just three rafts, me, and one employee, Colleen,” Matthew recalls), it’s grown substantially in the past eight years. While the Morettis kept the brand name (Bangs Island) for their mussels, they created a new company called Wild Ocean Aquaculture. When they first started their self-funded operation, the Morettis were producing less than30,000 pounds of mussels per year. They had a skiff, a barge, and some rafts, but no wharf space, so each day they would haulthe boat in and out of the water. Now the company has ten rafts and ten employees and harvested about 260,000 pounds of mussels in 2018. They’ve also automated much of the process. While they used to sort and process the mussels by hand, now they use a declumping machine toseparate out the delicate creatures. Matthew no longer shovels all day long—he’s spending a lot more time in his office on Portland’s Maine Wharf—but he looks back fondly on those hard, early days of the business. “It was tough,” he says. “But it has been rewarding.” Although the company is known best for its meaty mussels, which have been praised on the pages of the New York Times, Outside magazine, and the Boston Globe, Wild Ocean Aquaculture also farms kelo for human consumption and has begun to expand into farming sea scallops, although those wont be ready for sale for some time. “Scallops are still a guess,” Gary admits. “We don’t know if it will be viable. It requires a lot of labor. We’re not betting the farm on scallops, but we’re slowly investigating it.” Matthew and Gary have similar speaking styles, but where Matthew is careful and a bit reticent, Gary is loquacious and peppers his conversations with similies and metaphors. To help me, a landlubber, understand the bivalve and kelp business, Gary likens their company to a farm, because it is a farm, even though they are growing underwater rather than in the dirt and their crops grow on ropes rather than inside greenhouses. Gary points out that the investment in growing scallops is a bit like starting a Christmas tree farm, although there’s an added element of uncertainty because there isn’t a long history of scallop farming in America. It’s a fairly new process, and Wild Ocean wants to be on the vanguard of the movement. Matthew and Gary are using a method developed in Japan that involves drilling tiny holes in the “ear” of the scallop shell (the rectangular tab located by the hinge) to attach the scallops to ropes that hang from long lines running across the surface of the ocean. This work has been funded in part by Coastal Enterprises Inc. in Brunswick. With the help of a $300,000 research grant from the Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research, Coastal Enterprises purchased three scallop aquaculture machines to test these new-to-America farming techniques. Wild Ocean Aquaculture is now employing the most Japanese scallop-farming equipment ever used by a U.S. scallop farm. “It’s one of the first serious attempts to farm Atlantic sea scallops in the United States,” noted Patrick Whittle, reporting on the project for the Associated Press in August 2018. “Farming scallops in the cold waters of Maine is no small feat.” But Gary and Matthew want to try, not only because it will diversify their offerings (and thus their potential for earnings) but also because it could be good for Maine’s future economic growth. University of Maine professor Brian Beal explains that aquaculture is a demonstrated “job-creating mechanism.” According to data collected by the Department of Marine Resources, over 75 percent of the value generated by Maine’s seafood industry in 2017 came from lobster. (Herring came next at just 3.2 percent, followed by clams, elvers, scallops, and worms.) “That’s pretty dangerous,” says Beal, who is also director of research at Downeast Institute in Washington County. “That means we essentially have a monoculture.” He points out that there are more lobsters off the coast of Maine now than any other time since the start of commercial fishing in the late 1800s. “As an ecologist and a biologist, when I look at the pie chart for commercial fisheries in Maine, I’m quite concerned. I don’t think what we have is sustainable.” If Maine’s ocean-based industries were to diversify—say, by farming more mussels, clams, oysters, and scallops—the state might have more control over its economic destiny. While we don’t know exactly what climate change will do to Maine’s lobster fishing, it is likely that as the oceans warm the lobsters will begin moving north to New Brunswick. And the changes are coming fast. Over the past 15 years, this region has been heating up over seven times faster than the rest of the ocean. This news is alarming, for Maine’s environment and also for our seafood industry. Mussels, unlike lobsters, can thrive in the waters off the New Jersey coast, which is “substantially warmer, as we all know, than Maine,” says Beal. While many of the mussels consumed in Maine are harvested from the wild, there’s a real potential for aquaculture companies such as Wild Ocean to take root offshore. Both Matthew and Gary avoid talking about hot-button topics like global warming and politics, but they do espouse environmentalist beliefs. Sustainability is the “core mission” of Wild Ocean. “Recently, we’ve been working with the Island Institute and Bigelow Labs to better understand the climate-change-mitigating effects of kelp farming,” says Matthew. Soon after they purchased the company, Matthew and Gary began experimenting with growing kelp alongside their mussels. They chose this sea vegetable for several reasons. First, they believed it could be an expanding market. As Portland’s local food scene expands, it only makes sense that more people (or at least, more chefs) will begin experimenting with “the only winter-grown produce that thrives in Maine,” as Gary calls it. “Year after year, we put kelp in,” he says. “We’ve never made a profit off of it. But we know it’s the right thing to do.” Kelp cleans the water by extracting elements that can be harmful in coastal ecosystems, particularly if they are present in excessive amounts, such as nitrogen and phosphorous. Mussels, too, work to clean the water. Just as houseplants help clean your bedroom air, these organisms work to keep the ocean healthy. “It’s a small-scale effect,” Matthew adds, “but it is something you can do on a local scale. We’re sucking up excess carbon from the ocean, taking it out, and feeding it to people.” (Beal is more cautious about whether kelp can help mitigate the effects of climate change. “It’s a good hypothesis,” he says. “I don’t know if it’s shown to be the case on the larger scale.” He mentions that kelp does oxygenate the water, which is good for maintaining sea life.) In addition to growing sustainable foods, the Morettis are also committed to using nontoxic materials and eco-friendly fuels. Matthew and Gary use food-grade hydraulic oil on the sites where they harvest, and they use heavy-metal-free paint for the bottom of their boats. Gary points out that the paint used on the bottom of most boats is “notoriously toxic—by design.” Fishermen and sea- farmers don’t want barnacles or algae growing on the bottom of their vessels. “We found the most environmentally sensitive stuff we could use,” he says. For Gary and Matthew, these seemingly small decisions “aren’t really choices.” According to Gary, they are just the cost of doing business on Earth. “We don’t get to do it our way. We have to do it the way,” he says. “If there isn’t a good, healthy way to do things, we have to find it.” Another core tenet of the Wild Ocean mission is providing consistent work for employees and consistent product for buyers. It’s tricky to farm mussels year-round, since they spawn only in a short month-long window during the summer, but Wild Ocean has figured out a good balance. Since they need to supply their clients with consistent, readily available product (this is particularly important for restaurants who want to put local mussels on the menu), the Morettis carefully select where they place their rafts and rigorously control the density of the mussels growing in any given area. The Moretti men have grown their business substantially, but they seem to value slow growth over quick. Jon Gorman, farm manager for Wild Ocean, spent years working on commercial fishing boats in Alaska before he moved to Maine. “Fishing is boom or bust,” he says. “You get rich, or you live out of a backpack. But I came to want steadiness.” He enjoys spending his days on the water harvesting mussels and kelp, but more important, he relies on the steady paycheck, the consistent work. “We’re trying to create working waterfront jobs that are steady, reliable, and year-round. It’s very different from commercial fishing,” says Gorman. Everyone at the company seems enamored with their product, and for good reason. The mussels are excellent: meaty, smooth, a bit sweet, a bit briny. They taste good cooked in white wine and doused with lemon, but Gorman likes to eat them straight from the shell. “If there’s a cracked one, I’ll slurp it up on the barge,” he says. Gary compares the mussels to a fine wine from Tuscany. The same grapes, he said, could be grown anywhere, and make “an OK bottle of wine, all said and done.” But there are some pockets of soil that grow incredible Tuscan wines, and there are some pockets of Casco Bay where mussels truly thrive. Since mussels are sold by the pound, the Wild Ocean staff are constantly measuring the meat-to-shell ratio to guarantee that they’re providing a good value (and an enjoyable eating experience, since no one likes picking through a crowded bowl of shells to get a bite or two of meat). Growing these plump mussels takes vigilance—keeping predators, like ducks, away from the barges, for example, and keeping the nets clean. “It takes consistent effort to keep mussels happy, but when you do the results can be incredible,” says Matthew. “They’re really lazy old mussels,” Gary says with a laugh. “They like to hang on a rope and do nothing but feed, with no competition except each other. They grow fast, they grow fat, and they’re really well taken care of.” That is, he adds, “up until the final moment” when they’re tossed into the pot. Unlike the idle mussels, Matthew and Gary have committed to a life of hard work, bringing aquatic bounty from shovel to stovetop. The results so far have been sweet—for Maine’s restaurants, our economy, and our busy working waterfront.",neutral,seaweed aquaculture,2018,Maine
51,9708,50 Mainers | 2019 | Maine magazine,"One of Maine’s greatest assets is its people—the industrious, creative, and entrepreneurial individuals who are proud to call Maine home. But sometimes, no amount of dedication or talent is enough for someone to reach their goal. That’s where these 50 individuals come in. The best leaders help those around them to succeed, and the following pages are filled with people supporting their fellow Mainers to reach their greatest potential. They’re teaching immigrants and young people skills needed to succeed in the workforce. They’re supporting our farmers and loggers as they adapt to a changing economy. They’re guiding our entrepreneurs and connecting them with resources to grow their businesses. Maine’s future is brighter because of the people each of these Mainers has helped along the way. Betsy Biemann | CEO of Coastal Enterprises, Inc.  Betsy Biemann believes that if you work hard, you should be able to earn a decent livelihood. In 2016 she became the CEO of Coastal Enterprises, a community development investor that finances and advises small businesses that provide jobs and strengthen communities in rural regions and small gateway cities. Since its founding, CEI has evolved into a family of organizations that work across Maine, northern New England, and nationally. In her role, Biemann oversees diverse programs that coach women and immigrant entrepreneurs, use tax credits to redevelop historic buildings, and finance large companies, and advocates for public policies expanding access to the internet, childcare, and affordable housing. Biemann says CEI’s investments help people in rural communities thrive and reinvent themselves. “Seeing businesses grow and the pride that people have in their work is incredibly rewarding,” she says of the 40,000 full-time jobs that CEI has helped create and retain over its 41-year history. Before joining CEI, Biemann worked at the Rockefeller Foundation, served as president of Maine Technology Institute, and led a Harvard University study highlighting how Maine’s farming, food, and beverage manufacturing industries generate business and job growth and contribute to statewide prosperity. She serves on the board of the Elmina B. Sewall Foundation, which aims to improve the lives of Maine’s people and the environment in which they live. Through her leadership at CEI, Biemann works toward building an economy that benefits all Mainers. “When the economy is not working for everyone, it is not working for Maine or our nation,” she says. Abdullahi Ali | Founder + CEO of Gateway Community Services  When Abdullahi Ali was a child growing up in refugee camps in Dadaab, Kenya, his parents taught him the importance of charity work, and he remembers helping his neighbors collect water and firewood for cooking. “I believe the best way to show gratitude is to give back to those in need,” Ali says. “Even if it’s as little as a smile.” In 2007 he became the first person in his family to go to college when he enrolled at the University of Nairobi to study sociology. Two years later, Ali moved to Maine as a refugee. He finished his undergraduate career at the University of Southern Maine, and received his master of science degree in justice studies from Southern New Hampshire University. In 2014 he founded Gateway Community Services in Portland, an organization that provides counseling for children and adults, and youth empowerment services, with a focus on immigrants and refugees. Ali’s background allows him to relate to the needs of immigrants. He helps them find training to learn English, apply for jobs, secure housing, and integrate with the community. “I understand the struggles and challenges that immigrants face,” he says. “And because of this, I strive to create an environment where immigrants and other Mainers can feel safe and empowered.” Within the past five years, under Ali’s leadership, Gateway Community Services has served over 1,000 individuals and opened locations in Lewiston and Augusta. It now employs more than 100 people. Kate Braestrup | Chaplain of the Maine Warden Service  When Kate Braestrup was 33 years old, her husband was killed in a car crash while on duty as a Maine state trooper. In 2001, five years after her husband’s death, Braestrup found a place to translate her grief into a useful position of leadership by becoming the chaplain of the Maine Warden Service. “I can recognize the distress that people experience when met with calamity, and I am honored to work with Maine game wardens in providing care and compassion,” Braestrup says. As a chaplain, she provides pastoral care for game wardens and their families and serves the search-and-rescue teams by consoling civilians whose loved ones are lost in the Maine woods—a job she feels privileged to do. She also travels the country to train law enforcement officers on how to refine their care and comfort skills and teaches recruits at the Maine Criminal Justice Academy how to give death notifications. Because of her dedication to training Maine’s officers and in recognition of her 18 years of service as a chaplain, she has been honored with the University of Maine’s Maryann Hartman Award and the Maine Warden Service’s Exemplary Service Award. Her life experiences and grief counseling skills are also the focus of her New York Times bestseller, Here If You Need Me, a memoir recounting her journey from life after her husband’s death to becoming an ordained minister and eventually finding her calling as a chaplain. Amanda Beal | Commissioner of the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation + Forestry  Amanda Beal has fond memories from growing up on a dairy farm in Litchfield, but the experience also instilled in her a sense of the hard work required to be a farmer. Later, when she began helping to develop a succession plan for her younger brother to take over the family farm, she discovered how complicated and challenging ownership transitions can be for farmers. It’s an issue facing farms across Maine, with older farmers retiring and trying to find a way to transition ownership of their farmland, and one that Beal addressed when she became president and CEO of Maine Farmland Trust. “That point of transition can be a real point of vulnerability for farms. If it doesn’t feel like you can make other options work or if pressed for time to make a change, the future of that land can be at risk for development,” Beal says. “The amount of really good farmland soil is finite.” Now, as commissioner of the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation, and Forestry, her purview is even more broad. “I have a tremendous amount of respect for those who make their living from the land, like our farmers and foresters, and see our natural resource base here in Maine as the real and most enduring backbone of our economy,” Beal says. “Having grown up in a farming family, I also appreciate what a special upbringing I had, and want to ensure that our family farms thrive, and that farming is a viable way of life for generations to come.” Brian F. Beal | Director of Research at the Downeast Institute + Professor of Marine Ecology at the University of Maine at Machias  Brian F. Beal has played a pivotal role in enhancing Maine’s marine economy since the 1980s. In 1986 his work was instrumental in instituting Maine’s first lobster hatchery, and in 1987 he helped to create Maine’s first public clam hatchery. More recently, Beal helped open the easternmost marine research laboratory and education center in the United States, on Great Wass Island in Beals. The research and education facility is part of the Downeast Institute, an organization dedicated to improving downeast and coastal Mainers’ quality of life through marine research and marine science education. Beal is the director of research at the Downeast Institute and a professor of marine ecology at the University of Maine at Machias, and he shares his knowledge with a wide variety of people, including teachers and their students (ranging from kindergarteners to high school seniors) and clammers, fishers, and fishery managers. Beal’s applied research not only has scientific ramifications, it also has significance for the local economy and workforce, such as a recent study of soft-shell clam survival rates. “The study answered interesting theoretical questions about the ecology of soft-shell clam juveniles,” Beal says, “while at the same time it answered a very applied question that communities would have if they are trying to enhance clamming stocks in their flats.” Meris J. Bickford, ESQ. | CEO of the Maine State Society for the Protection of Animals  The first time Meris Bickford stepped inside the Maine State Society for the Protection of Animals (MSSPA), she fell in love. “Being here is like a calling, as though all of my previous life experiences were simply preparation for what was needed here, to reinvigorate the organization and rescue the financially failing shelter,” Bickford says. The Windham-based nonprofit organization rescues and rehabilitates abused and neglected horses and helps find new homes for the rescued equines. MSSPA largely relies on volunteers and donations to maintain operations. Bickford, who started with the society in 2007 and took over as CEO in 2011, has been fundamental in the organization’s revitalization and continued success. One significant change she implemented was the integration and development of core volunteer groups, including women who are incarcerated at the Southern Maine Women’s Reentry Center, also in Windham. There’s a parallel of healing between the women from the center and the rescued horses, Bickford says. The women see firsthand that the horses can recover, and it helps to facilitate their own recoveries. Bickford developed an organizational foundation for the non-profit by overseeing the creation of a website and newsletter, creating development functions and a budget for the organization, staffing the board of directors, lobbying on animal welfare issues, and beginning conversations to seek financial support, all while mucking stalls and feeding horses. “If I ever feel discouraged in my efforts here—which is rare,” she says, “I just go out to the barns and look into the faces of those who are depending on me.” Donna Cassese | Government Relations Consultant for Sappi North America  For more than four decades, Donna Cassese has worked for Sappi North America, a global wood products company, and in 2008 she took over as managing director of the company’s Westbrook mill. Built in 1854, the mill now produces 40 percent of the world’s supply of release paper, which is used to produce coated fabrics and laminates for creating products such as car seats, handbags, and flooring. “This growth is based on our commitment to innovation and investment,” says Cassese, who now serves as Sappi’s Maine-based government relations consultant, a position that allows her to focus on the future of Maine’s paper industry. Cassese works with the FOR/Maine initiative to advocate for expanding Maine’s traditional forest products with new products made from wood, such as bioplastics, jet fuel, and chemicals. “I want to ensure that the forest industry continues to be a strong contributor to our economy,” she says. Cassese hopes the industry will continue to provide work opportunities for Maine’s high school graduates. “I have the privilege of working with and developing many young people in the industry,” she says. “Giving back to the forest industry, which has such a long legacy in Maine, is a privilege.”   Reade Brower | Owner of Masthead Maine  “You come to the place that you’re meant to be if you can go with the flow,” says Reade Brower. “None of this was by design.” By this, Brower is referring to owning six of Maine’s seven daily newspapers and more than 20 weekly publications. The level of consolidation among Maine’s newspapers by Brower’s media group, Masthead Maine, is unprecedented in the state, but Brower remains hands-off in the day-to-day operations of his publications and stays out of editorial decisions. His expansion into daily newspapers came in 2015 when he approached Maine Today Media, publisher of the Portland Press Herald, Kennebec Journal, and Morning Sentinel, about printing some of their papers. Instead, owner Donald Sussman suggested he buy the papers. “I just could not say no each time an opportunity rose. It seemed like it was a win-win. It would help create a sustainable business to help what I already have survive, and it also was a good way for the papers involved to find a good home.” Brower now owns three printing presses. That, along with other synergies among his publications, has made the newspapers more sustainable and allowed the newsrooms to avoid the kind of cuts that have gutted other local papers across the country, he says. “I think the biggest job of a newspaper is to be a watchdog and provide information to citizens about their communities,” Brower says. “If you’re doing those two things, you’re doing a good job.” Jim Brady | Cofounder + President of Fathom Companies  Eight years after winning a silver medal in the 1992 Barcelona Olympic Games for sailing, Jim Brady moved to Maine to work as a real estate developer. As a professional sailor, Brady would not only operate the boat; he would also hire the naval architects and boat builders and choose race venues and the crew. “I found that those project-management skills were transferrable into real estate development,” says Brady, who in 2017 cofounded Fathom Companies, a real estate development company with a focus on historic renovations. Portland’s proximity to the ocean and its historic character are what drew Brady to Maine. “The creativity of our business community and the vibrant cultural life make Portland a great place to live, and I have found a way to contribute to the local community by preserving historic buildings in urban areas.” Four years ago, Brady and his team opened the Press Hotel and Union restaurant in the former Portland Press Herald headquarters. “We took a decaying historical building and brought a level of hospitality to Portland that didn’t exist before,” Brady says. Two blocks from the Press Hotel is another of Brady’s projects: 80 Exchange St., an office building in the Old Port. Brady led the preservation and renovations of the brick structure by adding new finishes and restrooms. A new mural with bright colors and abstract shapes was recently completed on the southeast-facing wall to replace another mural that was removed during the renovations—a piece of public art that Brady says adds vibrancy to Portland’s downtown. In addition to his role at Fathom Companies, Brady is a member of the Portland Regional Chamber of Commerce, is on the board at SailMaine, and is a trustee at Maine Preservation. Ed Cervine | Executive Director of Educate Maine  Ed Cervone returned to Maine in 2014 to lead Educate Maine, a business-led nonprofit that advances education policies and practices to prepare Maine students for the workforce. Before leaving for an out-of-state job, Cervone spent six years at the Maine Development Foundation, including as president and CEO. The goal of Educate Maine is to help Mainers reach their greatest educational potential. When that happens, Cervone says, “health improves, the economy grows, communities strengthen, and Maine becomes an even better place to live. It is easily Maine’s best investment strategy.” Educate Maine is one of the founding organizations of MaineSpark, an initiative to have 60 percent of Maine’s workforce earn some kind of credential, such as a trade certificate or college degree, by 2025. In the past two years, the total has grown from 42 percent to 46 percent, Cervone says. His organization is also known for its annual Education Indicators report, which measures the performance of Maine’s entire education system, from preschool participation to postsecondary credentials. “If you don’t even know where you’re at, the destination is a difficult decision,” Cervone says. “We now know where we’re at. We know where the kids are at, and we know where they should be.” Policymakers, educators, businesses, and other organizations can use the research to make investments or other strategic planning decisions. One of the most useful ways the indicator report is used is to evaluate the achievement gap between students from different demographics, Cervone says. “We won’t be successful if kids are being left behind,” Cervone says. “We don’t have enough bodies as it is. We can’t afford—mathematically or morally—to allow any kid that’s getting a public education in Maine to not get every opportunity their peers do.” Patrisha McLean | Photojournalist + Founder of Finding Our Voices: Breaking the Silence of Domestic Abuse  After her ex-husband’s arrest for domestic abuse made worldwide news, Patrisha McLean was shocked when people all around—close friends and acquaintances—started whispering to her about the domestic abuse in their own lives. That is when she realized how widespread domestic violence is, and how much it affects women’s lives. “No one knows because no one talks about it,” she says. Now, McLean is using photography and audio to break the silence about domestic abuse in Maine. She has created a multimedia exhibition called Finding Our Voices: Breaking the Silence of Domestic Abuse that features portraits of 21 women, from all over Maine, all ages, and all walks of life, along with audio of their voices telling their story of domestic abuse and their journey out of it. McLean, who serves as a board member of the Next Step Domestic Abuse Agency in Ellsworth and volunteers for the Knox County Homeless Coalition, is bringing her exhibition and panel discussions with domestic abuse survivors to libraries, art galleries, high schools, colleges, and prisons across the state. This fall the exhibition will be at the Holocaust and Human Rights Center in Augusta. She provides a platform for women to join her in speaking out about the domestic abuse in their lives for personal healing, to help other women, to educate communities, and to get accountability and justice. “Too many women are dying in Maine at the hands of their intimate partners,” she says. For the 29 years of McLean’s marriage, she was terrified of public speaking and kept a shield up with other women. Since her divorce, McLean says her friendships are deeper and more substantive. “I finally talk to women about things that matter to me, and us, and about things that are going on in our lives,” she says. “Enough of us speaking out will change the question from ‘Why does she stay'’ to ‘Why does he abuse'’” Mufalo Chitam | Executive Director of the Maine Immigrants’ Rights Coalition  When Mufalo Chitam moved from Zambia to Maine in 2002 with her husband and two-year-old daughter, she noticed an absence of black African women in leadership positions. As executive director of the Maine Immigrants’ Rights Coalition (MIRC), Chitam is working to create a more diverse Maine for future generations of immigrant children. “I want to ensure that immigrant girls and boys are growing up in a place where more leaders look and sound like me,” Chitam says. Through MIRC, an immigrant-led nonprofit organization that was founded in 2005 by the Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project, Chitam oversees over 60 organizations with shared values, including advocacy groups such as the Maine Business Immigration Coalition and workforce development groups such as Portland Adult Education and ECBOs like ProsperityME, that work together to benefit new Mainers. She also works to improve legal, social, and economic conditions for Maine’s immigrants, and aims to build “a future Maine that is based on principles of justice, economic security, and inclusion.” Before she became MIRC’s first executive director in 2017, Chitam founded and ran the Empower the Immigrant Woman Conference, which is a current member of the MIRC. She also mentors more than 30 immigrant teenagers who belong to the Pihcintu Multicultural Chorus, a traveling singing group that gives young children from war-torn villages a place to express themselves through music. Greg Dufour | President and CEO of Camden National Bank + Camden National Corporation  Greg Dufour often asks himself how he can make a difference in someone’s life. “As the president and CEO of Camden National Bank, I aspire to bring that mindset to every element of our community efforts,” Dufour says. Having worked with Camden National for 18 years, he is experienced at managing his team as they protect the safety of their depositors’ money, maintain jobs across the state, and influence the bank’s communities by raising awareness about homelessness. “In Maine, we know there are often two degrees of separation between people,” Dufour says. “To me, that is the ultimate form of accountability.” In 2015 Dufour led the launch of [email protected], an ongoing program that donates $100 to a homeless shelter every time a customer finances a home purchase through the bank. Employees have also been highly involved in the mission of [email protected] Three years ago they collected Hope Kits, packages filled with toiletries and nonperishable food items to be donated to the shelters. In four years, [email protected] has raised over $385,000. Each shelter determines the best way to use the funds—whether it’s purchasing food and clothing, doing building repairs, paying staff, or another necessity. Because of his leadership, last year Dufour was honored in the Junior Achievement Business Hall of Fame. “I’m most proud of the passion and purpose our employees bring to helping our communities,” Dufour says. Lois Dodd | Painter  For more than 70 years Lois Dodd has sat at a canvas and taken in the world around her, translating fragments of nature into painted works of art. Dodd has long been admired for her paintings, which often depict close-ups of flowers, trunks and branches of trees, and the perspective seen through many different windows. Her works demonstrate her sharpened ability to capture complexity in simple subjects. Although she wasn’t born in Maine, Dodd has been coming here since 1951. She spends most of her summers in Cushing, splitting her time between Maine, the Delaware Water Gap, and New York. What continues to draw her back is the inspiration she finds in the immediate environment, she says. “Maine has a landscape light that is more dramatic and graphically clear than that of more southernly locations,” Dodd says. “The strong light-and dark-value contrast provides a visual simplification of shape and forms and denies disruptive detail.” Dodd, who is now 92, has since 1998 been an elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, an honor society comprising 250 renowned artists, architects, writers, and composers throughout the United States. In addition, Dodd has taught at a number of schools, including Brooklyn College, Queens College, Wagner College, and the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture, before retiring in 2011 from her nearly 50-year teaching career. She now focuses her time on continuing to capture the moment on canvas. “I do it for myself, and if other people see something in it, great. But, first and foremost, I must challenge and please myself,” she says. “The more personal an expression can be is also the most universal it can become.” Charles E. Hewett, Phd | Executive Director of the Institute for Digital Engineering + Life Sciences +  Former Executive Vice President + Chief Operating Officer of Jackson Laboratories  Charles Hewett was born in Lewiston and moved back to Maine in 1983 to create high-quality jobs for Mainers. “Great employment opportunities in Maine have been elusive,” Hewett says. “That’s why I am committed to enhancing the quality of life for my fellow Maine people.” Hewett is the executive director and a founding board member of the Institute for Digital Engineering and Life Sciences, a Portland-based professional graduate program that plans to open in 2021. The school will focus on training digital engineers in areas such as cyber-security and life sciences analysts in areas such as bioinformatics. Before working on the graduate program, Hewett worked for 15 years as executive vice president and chief operating officer at the Jackson Laboratory (JAX). The Bar Harbor–based biomedical research nonprofit works to find genomic solutions to cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, addiction, and other diseases. During his time at JAX, Hewett established a strong financial and organization foundation for the institution. JAX currently employs more than 1,400 people in Maine and contributed more than $630 million to the state’s economy in Hewett’s last year there. During his time at the institution, Hewett created the Maine Cancer Genomics Initiative, which introduced Maine’s oncology practices to a new approach to cancer treatments. He also supported his team as they executed preclinical trials for the first drug to treat spinal muscular atrophy, a life-threatening spinal cord disease. “I take pride in the teams I have built and all that they have achieved working together,” Hewett says. In 2018 JAX opened the Charles E. Hewett Center, a state-of-the-art research mouse production facility named after Hewett. Holly S. Anderson | Assistant Director of the Camden Snow Bowl + Chairwoman of U.S. National Toboggan Championships Organizing Committee  “Each year the Toboggan Nationals culminates in a big family reunion,” says Holly Anderson, who has been involved in the event since first racing in it in 1998. She returned the following year as a volunteer, and in 2017 she became the assistant director at the Camden Snow Bowl, a town-owned recreation area that has hosted the toboggan race since 1991. “We all come together, bring a few new friends and family members, gear up for a little competition, and celebrate having fun in the cold, like any other family in Maine would,” says Anderson, who is chairwoman of the U.S. National Toboggan Championships organizing committee. The annual event helps to support the Snow Bowl’s operations and brings the community together during one of the coldest, darkest times of the year. Each February, up to 425 teams, composed of 1,300 racers from all over the country, and 6,000 spectators take part in the three-day-long event. The original (and only still-operational) 400-foot wood chute was built in 1937, and while it has been repaired and updated, some original timbers are still in place. Anderson feels lucky to have built a long-term relationship with committee members and the community. Year after year, she sees a consistent devotion from long-term racers and her committee coworkers. “I have never lived in a community with so many people who give their time and talents to others,” she says, “and I love being with these hardworking, community-minded, altruistic people.” Erin French | Chef of the Lost Kitchen  Erin French grew up down the road from a crumbling grist mill in Freedom. As a child she worked in her family’s nearby restaurant, and like many others from rural towns, she thought she would have to leave to find success. Instead, she found it with a supper club she hosted in a Belfast apartment. She turned the supper club into an acclaimed but short-lived restaurant, its run and her culinary ascension cut short by a bitter divorce. Locked out of her restaurant and apartment, the only thing she retained from the business was its name: the Lost Kitchen. Then one of the farmers she knew from her Belfast restaurant told her that the old Freedom mill, which had recently been renovated, needed a tenant. “I saw the place, and I said, ‘Oh, my god. I can see a future here,’” French says. “I just started to dream about the space.” When she opened in July 2014 in the grist mill that was on its own second life, her customers were waiting. Now, reservations for the prix-fixe dinners are secured by a raffle system. This year 20,000 people mailed postcards to the restaurant during a two-week stretch in April for a chance at a seating. In its fifth year, the restaurant is a “well-oiled machine,” French says. “I feel like I’ve found this little bit of perfection and we got it and we know what it is and I don’t want to lose it.” She can’t imagine running her restaurant anywhere else. “To me, Maine has always been home and has always been the place that’s made me feel loved,” she says. “I feel like I can be my true self here.” Renee Fay-Leblanc, MD FACP | Chief Medical Officer at Greater Portland Health  Renee Fay-LeBlanc believes that everyone has a right to quality, affordable healthcare. Since 2014 she has served as chief medical officer for Greater Portland Health, a nonprofit medical practice dedicated to providing care for patients regardless of their ability to pay. “I feel honored to do this work in my community and to try to make people’s lives better,” says Fay-LeBlanc, a Portland native. Greater Portland Health provides nearly 12,000 patients with services such as primary care, integrated behavioral care, and dental care. The health center sees more than 100 new patients a month and has nine locations in Portland and South Portland, including a site in Portland’s Bayside neighborhood to serve people experiencing homelessness. Greater Portland Health also partners with other community organizations to ensure that Maine’s immigrants and refugees have access to high-quality medical services. In addition to this outreach, Fay-LeBlanc and her team travel to meet patients where they live, on the streets, and at local schools. “We have an amazing team who help make what I do every day possible,” Fay-LeBlanc says. In addition to her work with the health center, she serves as an active member of the Williston-Immanuel United Church’s outreach committee, volunteers for Family Promise, and serves as a member of the board at Avesta Housing. Tim Glidden | President of Maine Coast Heritage Trust  Tim Glidden has spent his entire career conserving Maine’s natural resources, working with a variety of stakeholders to protect irreplaceable assets. “The satisfaction that comes from conserving land, it’s so strong, so lasting, there’s really nothing like it if you care about Maine and Maine’s environment,” he says. As a child, Glidden remembers running through the woods behind his family’s home and waking up on summer nights to hear loons calling across Damariscotta Lake. “There’s a deep connection to the vast natural world which reminds me of my modest place and my responsibility to care for creation,” he says. Glidden, president of Maine Coast Heritage Trust (MCHT) since 2011, previously served as director of the state’s Land for Maine’s Future program, deputy director of the Natural Resources Council of Maine, and as an environmental policy analysis for the Maine legislature. In his time with the Land for Maine’s Future (LMF) program, one of his proudest achievements was being part of the team that reached a deal with a paper company to permanently conserve 50 miles of the Machias River mainstream and tributaries, which he calls “truly one of Maine’s hidden gems.” Another memorable victory came in 2014 when the owners of the Goslings, a group of small islands off Mere Point in Brunswick, needed to sell the land. Working with LMF and generous donors of every size, MCHT helped raised well over $1 million to buy the land and turn it into a public preserve. “I just feel that it has been an immense privilege to live and work in Maine, in all sorts of ways, protecting what makes Maine such a special place,” Glidden says. “It’s work that helps me stay optimistic.” Adam Gardner + Lauren Sullivan | Cofounders of REVERB  Lauren Sullivan and Adam Gardner have been to their fair share of concerts.

52,9713,Sea Change - The Maine Mag,"At Atlantic Sea Farms’ production facility in Saco, a small group of women in hairnets and gloves are packing freshly blanched ribbons of deep green kelp into plastic bags. President and CEO Briana Warner offers me a taste, and the pleasantly crunchy strands remind me not so much of the sea as, surprisingly, of green beans. Its versatile ﬂavor is just one reason to embrace this nutrient-dense, sustainable Maine product. In just 18 months, Warner has transformed and rebranded Ocean Approved, which originated in 2009 as the ﬁrst commercial seaweed farm in the United States, into a model of culinary innovation and forward-thinking economic development with the motto “Kelp the earth.” This year, Atlantic Sea Farms will work with 24 ﬁshermen from Casco Bay to Eastport (up from 16 in 2019) and expects to harvest 600,000 pounds of fresh kelp. The kelp plants are started on kite string in ﬁltered seawater at the Saco facility and given to the ﬁshermen, who coil the string around rope and submerge it seven feet underwater. The mature kelp is harvested, cleaned, cut, blanched, and frozen. It is then offered in packages of ready-cut kelp and pureed kelp cubes for food service and retail. And last fall, the company rolled out its ﬁrst jarred products: Fermented Seaweed Salad, which is made with blanched kelp, and Sea-Beet Kraut and Sea-Chi—a mild kimchi—both made from raw kelp fermented in barrels by a woman-owned small business in Rhode Island.  Q. Why should we eat kelp'  A. We call it the virtuous vegetable.  It’s fresh, it’s American, it’s clean, it’s farmed by ﬁshermen (not on big farms), it helps mitigate ocean acidiﬁcation, it’s super healthy, and it tastes good. It’s got more calcium than milk—more calcium per ounce than any food on the planet. It’s super high in potassium and iodine, which is great for thyroid function, and potassium, magnesium, and vitamin B12. Our fermented seaweed products have a ton of probiotics, which is good for gut health, and our kelp cubes add a nutrient boost to smoothies. They’re an incredible way to eat greens and get these nutrients for people who would not eat a seaweed salad—like my two young kids.  Q. What makes kelp farming such a good thing for Maine' A. I’m a development economist by trade, and I think the most fascinating way development economics can be applied is by helping to prevent a problem before it ever happens. As we know, the Gulf of Maine is warming faster than 99 percent of the world’s oceans, and the dominant ﬁshery on the Maine coast is lobster. Right now, we’re in the middle of a lobster boom, which means if we’re looking for ways for ﬁshermen to diversify their incomes in the face of impending climate change, they already have the boats, the equipment, and the capital. It’s a workforce of owner-operators who are super-qualiﬁed; they have a huge advantage over anyone else who wants to get into aqua-culture. Kelp is a lower-capital-barrier investment than other types of aquaculture, and kelp grows in the opposite season from lobster; it’s a winter crop, so it’s out of the water and proﬁtable, if you grow it at scale, before you have to put your lobster traps in. Another factor is that kelp not only helps people adapt to climate change, it also helps mitigate climate change. We have too much carbon in the air, which along with nitrogen from other sources is being absorbed by the ocean, making it more acidic. A shelled organism like a mussel or an oyster in a more acidic ocean is going to become increasingly more brittle. When you’re planting kelp, you’re creating an additional habitat, and when you pull it out, you remove carbon and nitrogen from the water. We did some research with the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences, growing mussels alongside our kelp, and found that the shells were almost doubly as strong in one six-month growing period. The mussel meat was also substantially larger, which could be part of the ocean acidiﬁcation piece, or that they were feeding off the nutrients from the kelp. Q. What are some good ways to use the ready-cut kelp'  A. It’s been our biggest seller in food service because chefs like to make their own, better version of the seaweed salad you see in sushi bars [which is dried, reconstituted, and dyed seaweed grown in Asia in water with a high lead content]. We have a recipe for the salad right on the retail package. A lot of people put it on salads; it adds a really great crunch. At her restaurants, Linda Bean puts it in a signature slaw called Kelpi-slaw. If you want to get a little more creative, it’s fantastic in pasta sauces, especially clam sauce, and paella, but you can also put it in soups such as minestrone, because the ﬂavor is fresh and vegetal.  Q. What was the reasoning behind the fermented kelp products' A. We made a baseline assumption that people who are seeking to eat seaweed are likely more adventurous and health focused, and probably more conscious about where their food is grown. The probiotic craze is really catching on; it’s the fastest growing grocery segment, yet it’s basically just kimchi, sauerkraut, and kombucha. We thought if we could innovate in the seaweed space and innovate in the fermented space that consumer group would be substantial. But we also needed to preserve it and an easy way to eat it. Fermentation works really well with seaweed, and it boosts the nutrients. Our Sea-Chi and our seaweed kraut are both raw, which helps people who are on the raw diet, and with our seaweed salad, we can make a healthier, more delicious, natural version of the seaweed salad usually found at sushi bars. It’s really easy to use right out of the jar, it tastes great, and it’s preserved for a year.",neutral,seaweed aquaculture,2020,Maine

54,9742,Former House Leader Seth Berry transitions into private sector with Kennebec River Biosciences | Mainebiz.biz,"Seth Berry of Bowdoinham served in the Maine Legislature for eight years (2006–14), ending his term as House majority leader. In January, Berry was hired by Richmond-based Kennebec River Biosciences as vice president for international business development. KRB, founded in 1996, provides testing and health services to farms, businesses, government agencies and scientific research institutions involved with aquatic species. KRB expects to double its staff over the next several years, from the current 14. Mainebiz recently chatted with Berry. An edited transcript follows. Mainebiz: How has your transition gone, moving from the public to the private sector'  Seth Berry: It's been great. Something I've thought about a lot in my time in the public sector is, How do we prepare our young people and our incumbent work force for the next economy' How do we make sure Maine is relevant in the global economy' I talked with a lot of business owners, scientists and non-profit folks who work in this arena. I've really done a lot of listening. It's really an exciting space, the innovation that's happening in Maine, just as it is in Silicon Valley or the beltway in Boston. Maine is clearly doing some great things. Often by boot strapping. But often by getting public support, as well, like from the Maine Technology Institute. MB: How did you pick Kennebec River Biosciences'  SB: In 2006, I was campaigning. I knocked on every door in the district. CEO Bill Keleher and office manager Rebecca Boulanger welcomed me into their offices. I was blown away by the kind of work they were doing. Very advanced, scientific diagnostic work supporting fisheries, fish farms, the health of aquatic animals. The lab was continually an example of the kind of business that we want to grow more of here in Maine, to make sure our state is relevant. KRB is providing a service and product that can't be outsourced. It adds value to Maine's economy and builds on a unique strength. We have a long tradition of fishing in Maine and this is one evolution of that history. MB: Research suggests more of the global diet will rely on fish and more of that fish will be farmed. How is KRB positioned to serve the farms that will support these trends'  SB: Yes, the kind of science we provide allows fish farmers to be more proactive, as opposed to reactive, in monitoring and supporting the health of their animals and in producing much healthier, fresher, tastier fish as well. Using very targeted vaccines really helps the fish farmers get away from the use of antibiotics. We also support farmers with better management techniques. They may not need a vaccine or health product. Sometimes, it's just understanding what pathogens you have in your aquatic environment and preventing them from erupting into a full-scale disease. We're all swimming in a sea of microbes. How do we use those beneficial microbes as well, for example. Science can help bring fish farming into a more responsible, more sustainable era. MB: One of your clients is an Idaho farmer who converted his cattle operation to a tilapia farm. With aquaculture becoming so popular, what's hot within the sector'  SB: It's not just catching more fish these days. It's utilizing more fully the fish that are harvested. There's a lot of interest right now in 'How do I get more from the fish that I'm bringing to market'' Are there parts of the fish that can be sold for something other than compost' Those are areas we've been supporting and bringing our science to bear. Centuries ago, Native Americans planted corn and beans together because the beans were nitrogen fixers. You can do similar things in aquaculture. It's called integrated multi-trophic aquaculture. It involves combining several species that benefit from one another's presence. For example, people are experimenting with farming fish, shellfish and seaweed together. Also, the industry is really moving forward in land-based recirculating aquaculture systems. It's absolutely astonishing how much is going on in this arena and how good the farm-to-product can be.",neutral,seaweed aquaculture,2015,Maine
55,9758,"Maine Food Insider: Edible seaweed, the next great Maine brand? | Mainebiz.biz","Edible seaweed is nothing new. Along Ireland's rocky coast, seaweed has been harvested for food for centuries, even, legend has it, brought along as a provision by St. Brendan on his fifth-century voyage to find paradise. It's a staple of Asian food and no sushi bar is without it. But Maine edible seaweed' Definitely not the stuff of legends, or even of most dinner tables. The Island Institute in Rockland is hoping to change that, foreseeing a future where edible seaweed is not only a Maine brand but also a sustainable addition to the economy island and coastal communities that depend so heavily on fishing and lobstering. On Friday the Island Institute will release a study that shows the possibilities for Maine's edible seaweed industry — from processing to packaging and selling locally. ""There's the potential for Maine to be the leader"" in processing and selling edible seaweed, Briana Warner, Island Institute's economic development director, told Mainebiz on Tuesday. The growth of the state's edible seaweed industry would not only put more local food into the marketplace, it also would give needed diversification for the state's fishing and lobster industries. So far, 48 people have taken part in the institute's training program, which also focuses on oyster- and mussel-growing. The training, which is in its second year, is more of a business support program than actual training, Warner said, explaining that it connects those who want to become seafood growers with the technical resources and information they need. Warner said those who have participated in the institute's program are new to seaweed growing, but familiar with working on the water. Seaweed is perfect for those who already harvest the ocean: it's a cold-weather crop and is not labor-intensive. ""They understand the water so well, and the technical side is fairly easy to learn,"" Warner said, adding that it also doesn't require a huge investment in capital to get started. Of course, a product needs a consumer, or it's not a product. ""Oysters and mussels are well established,"" she said. ""The edible seaweed supply chain is very small, it's limited."" According to the institute, ""Despite potential growth opportunities, the domestic market for edible seaweed and seaweed products remains underdeveloped, with minimal focus on value-added products."" That's where the study comes in. The institute commissioned the study to determine the market for edible seaweed and how it will work. The event, to be held at the University of Southern Maine, is for industry leaders, entrepreneurs and potential seaweed processors, who will hear about ""new and innovative ways to process, package and sell edible seaweed products,"" a news release about the event says. Speakers will include Sebastian Belle, of the Maine Aquaculture Association and Des Fitzgerald of the Maine Venture Fund. There will even be recipes. For instance, pork and beans with sugar kelp. ""It actually softens the beans faster, and adds a lot of flavor,"" Warner said. Or French onion soup, with sugar kelp instead of onion. ""It tastes a lot like French onion soup, but is packed with vitamins,"" she said, noting that the kelp is flavorful and a little salty and once cooked has a crunchy noodle texture. The institute worked with a chef to come up with recipes that are familiar to people, as well as make the best use of other Maine products. The plant is also nutritious. Low in calories and considered a superfood, it's loaded with antioxidants and nutrients, with one of the most essential being iodine, an essential mineral that many people don't get enough of in their diets. Warner said most of the seaweed sold commercially in the U.S. comes from Asia, harvested from water less clean than Maine's, and is dyed or processed in other ways. One of the reasons the product is custom-made for Maine is the clean, cold northern Atlantic water, which adds flavor and value, Warner said. The seaweed also complements other locally produced seafoods and vegetables. ""It's a natural Maine product,"" she said. The University of Maine's seaweed guide says that while many of the 250 types of seaweed are edible, only 11 are commercially harvested. It lists eight companies that harvest or market locally grown seaweed in the state. Warner said there is anecdotal proof that edible seaweed is a desired product. ""It would be a great brand for our seafood industry,"" she said. ""Nobody else in the country is really doing it.""",good,seaweed aquaculture,2017,Maine
56,9770,Briana Warner named CEO of Ocean Approved | Mainebiz.biz,"Ocean Approved Inc. announced today that its board of directors has unanimously chosen Briana Warner as the company's next chief executive officer. Warner is currently serving as senior community development officer at the Island Institute and will succeed CEO Paul Dobbins on July 2.

According to its website, it not only harvests kelp from its own farms it also works with farms operated by nine fishermen along the Maine coast. It's currently in a growth mode, focusing on responding to market demand by expanding its processing capacity and entering into buying contracts with more kelp farmers in Maine, according to a ""success story"" posted by CEI on its website. ""I am thrilled to be part of this exciting new industry in Maine,"" Warner said. ""Edible sea vegetables are healthy for the ocean and consumers and have endless possibilities for culinary innovation. I am excited to be stepping into a company that makes delicious and healthy products. I am also motivated by Ocean Approved's community-based supply chain, sourcing its line-grown seaweed directly from Maine's hard-working fisherman."" In a telephone interview with Mainebiz this morning, Warner said she sees her new venture with Ocean Approved as a natural progression of work she's been doing at Island Institute, the Rockland-based nonprofit that is working to sustain island and coastal communities in Maine. During her tenure at the Island Institute, she created a program that helped fishermen diversify into seaweed and shellfish aquaculture and is looking forward to working closely with many of those same fishermen at Ocean Approved. Whether it's growing oysters, mussels or various forms of seaweed, Warner said aquaculture increasingly is providing opportunities for Maine fishermen to create for themselves ""a diversified income stream."" Warner added that she's looking forward to returning to the food sector. Prior to joining the Island Institute she started, owned and then sold the Maine Pie Line, a highly acclaimed bakery that sold sweet and savory pies and created jobs for newly resettled refugees in Maine. And before that, she served as a diplomat in the U.S. Foreign Service in Libya, Guinea and the U.S. Mission to the European Union. ""I am thrilled to see Briana take the lead at Ocean Approved,"" said outgoing CEO Paul Dobbins. ""Given her track record of success at the Island Institute, broad industry contacts, and performance as an Ocean Approved board member, she is well positioned to take the company to the next level.'' Dobbins is stepping down from management of Ocean Approved and will be moving to Washington, D.C., to join a nonprofit. In his new role he will be helping to identify trends in marine algae aquaculture to sequester carbon while providing critical food and food ingredients that reduce key environmental impacts. Warner will join a seasoned management team with sales, marketing, processing and food safety experience. While the initial focus will be to continue to grow food service distribution and sales, she will spearhead the effort to bring Ocean Approved into the retail sector and innovate new products that will help expand the market for sea vegetables in the U.S. ""I've been brought on to focus on expanding into retail markets,"" Warner said.

57,9771,"Seaweed entrepreneur expands in Biddeford, launches new products | Mainebiz.biz","Ocean's Balance Inc., a Maine innovator of edible seaweed products, has moved into a new facility in the Pepperell Mill Campus in downtown Biddeford and will launch nine new edible seaweed products. The new products will be unveiled at the Fancy Food Trade Show, which will be held June 30 to July 2 in New York City. Ocean's Balance was founded in 2016 by Tollef Olson and Mitchell Lench. Olson is a long-time aquaculture operator and a senior advisor at the Macroalgae Nursery and Research Cluster in the University of New England's Center for Excellence in the Marine Sciences. Lench owns the impact investment management firm Treetops Capital in Cape Elizabeth. Olson launched his first product line — a shelf-stable kelp puree in 9-ounce jars for retail and gallon containers for the service industry — in January 2017, gaining traction with orders from New England, New York, Pennsylvania and California, with distributors in New Hampshire, New York and California. He sold his first processing facility, in a 1,156-square-foot building at 188 Presumpscot St. in Portland, in November 2017 to look for a larger space. Lisa Scali — who comes from a 20-year career in finance, then joined Ocean's Balance as a third principal and director of marketing and sales — told Mainebiz the new space in Biddeford is about 3,000 square feet. The company moved there in early May. They chose the space for several reasons, she said, including the innovative vibe of other new companies within the mill. ""There's room for us to grow, if we need to,"" Scali said. ""The rent is attractive. It's an exciting place to be."" Set-up involved installing a seaweed spore nursery in one room, another room for multiple purposes like drying seaweed, and a main space for processing and to house inventory, she said. They're sharing the space. The work is performed by the principals, plus an intern this summer. ""We'll be looking to take on additional staff, probably to start part-time, then full-time, this year if all goes well,"" she said. Earlier this year, Olson told Mainebiz that he and his partners have taken several routes toward building demand. That's included grants to aid product testing, placing product at seafood-friendly outlets like Harbor Fish Market on Portland's waterfront, and conducting frequent cooking and tasting demonstrations at venues like retail outlets, colleges and seafood shows.  The company, though small, has seen excellent growth, Scali said. ""The revenue in the first six months of 2018 eclipsed revenue for all of 2017, and it continues to come along at a very healthy clip,"" she said. Currently, working with distributors, Ocean's Balance is in 100 stores along the East Coast plus a few stores in California. Identification of new product forms was based on the success of the kelp puree, she said. ""You just open the jar and it's ready to use,"" she said. ""We wanted to continue to introduce products that were somewhat innovative in order to make seaweed more accessible. Our goal is to help people include it in their diet as often as possible."" The new lineup includes ""Seaweed Sprinkles"" in three varieties — spicy, bonito and shitake; plus three types of seaweed — dulse, kombu and wakame — with flake or whole leaf options. The Seaweed Sprinkles are inspired by Japanese furikake, which means ""sprinkle over,"" Scali said in a news release: ""Unlike traditional furikake, which uses a lot of sugar, salt and oil, ours contain less sugar and salt, no oil and are made with organic seaweed."" Scali, who developed the recipes, said the product can be used as toppings on rice, avocado toast, soups, salads and more. The organic dried flakes are available in reusable tins and the whole leaf option comes in a resealable pouch. Both are intended to provide a convenient ways to add seaweed to meals. Scali said she's been sampling the new products around New England, at retail shops like Browne Trading, LeRoux Kitchen, Cambridge Naturals and Portsmouth Health Food Center. They've been getting reorders and are in the process of rolling out to distributors. In general, the stores looking at the products have a health, seafood or Asian focus, she said. Overall output from hundreds of pounds of seaweed this year is at least 1,000 cases of puree, plus, in the last six weeks or so, at least 750 cases of sprinkles, and 100 to 200 cases each of flakes and whole leaf. Each case holds six packages. ""The plan is to continue to build up inventory this summer,"" she said. Some of the raw seaweed is harvested from Ocean's Balance's 400-square-foot limited purpose aquaculture lease sites on Casco Bay; the rest comes from other farms and from harvesters of wild seaweed. Limited purpose aquaculture lease sites are governed by the Maine Department of Marine Resources and are designed to provide small areas to research potential aquaculture operations.  The partners are looking into longer-term standard lease sites along the coast, Scali said. ""Ten years ago, I couldn't get anyone to look at seaweed, but now, seaweed is in demand, especially by those seeking healthy, sustainable foods,"" Olson said in the release. The partners expect continued growth, said Scali. ""In the next two to three years, we'd like to have doubled or tripled"" the size of the operation, Scali said.,good""",good,seaweed aquaculture,2018,Maine

""We are very excited and fortunate to be working with COA,"" Angera said in a news release announcing the partnership. ""There are tremendous opportunities for students to learn and experiment with seaweed aquaculture, and having so many fresh eyes on our processes will offer us many chances to improve what we do. It's going to be a great collaboration."" With the Gulf of Maine warming faster than 99% of oceans around the world and traditional Maine fisheries under threat, ocean farming is an important, sustainable practice with great potential, COA President Darron Collins said.  ""Anything we can do to help the coast of Maine diversify economically, and especially through our sustainable resource economy, provides a bulwark against changing environmental conditions and warming ocean waters,"" Collins said. ""Sarah and Trey are the best in the business and we are excited to have their help dreaming up and implementing all kinds of projects around this important type of work."" The 600-square-foot lab will produce a sizeable amount of stock, Redmond said. One foot of string, seeded with 2 millimeter plants in the lab, will produce up to 10 pounds of seaweed in the bay, she said. The facility will also contain a test kitchen and a small-scale tank aquaculture setup for year-round plants. Springtide grows four types of kelp and are working on cultivating dulse and nori for local waters. Beyond fresh and dried seaweed, they also sell seasonings and prepared food products like seaweed mac-n-cheese, popcorn, and pickled seaweed stipes. ""I'm really excited to have both Trey and Sarah working with the college,"" said Chris Petersen, a biology professor and associate academic dean at the college. ""They provide breadth and depth in areas that we are interested in but really don't have expertise, and they complement our work in marine conservation and climate change."" Angera and Redmond are in the process of launching a state-of-the-art processing facility on the other side of Frenchman Bay in Gouldsboro, Angera said. They also maintain a saltwater lab and production site in Port Clyde. The partnership opens a world of possibilities for the future of local ocean farming, said College of the Atlantic alumna Teagan White, class of 2018, whose senior project explored the possibilities for aquaculture at College of the Atlantic. ""Aquaculture is a growing industry in the global economy, and this has been especially visible in Maine,"" White said. ""Seaweed is currently one of the smallest sectors of aquaculture, but there is a lot of interest in it as a nutritious source of food, fertilizer, and potential environmental remediator of greenhouse gases and agricultural runoff."" White added that student interest in aquaculture is high. ""This partnership is an amazing opportunity for the students to get involved and get their hands salty,"" he said.",good,seaweed aquaculture,2018,Maine
59,9792,Island Institute planting seeds for 10-fold increase in Maine's aquaculture industry | Mainebiz.biz,"Since its inception in 2015, Island Institute's Aquaculture Business Development program has had 75 individuals go through the program, with 20 starting businesses that have contributed an estimated $3.1 million to Maine's economy. By 2020, the program's goal is to have helped start 60 businesses with an overall impact on Maine's economy totaling $36 million, according to the institute's Jan. 28 news release. The Island Institute is accepting applications for its 2019 Aquaculture Business Development program. The free program helps fishermen and those from fishing communities gain the tools they need to diversify and launch small-scale aquaculture businesses. The Island Institute is looking to work with coastal and island residents who are highly motivated to start a shellfish or seaweed aquaculture businesses within the next two years. Applications are being accepted through March 14. ""Maine's emerging aquaculture industry has a lot of opportunity and growth potential. The Aquaculture Business Development program provides both the academic and experiential learning tools to enter that growing arena,"" Peter Piconi, marine business specialist with the Island Institute, said in the release. ""More importantly, fisherman can diversify their income which, in turn, helps island and coastal economies thrive. We are excited to help a new group of individuals gain the tools they need to launch their aquaculture businesses."" Mainebiz spoke with Piconi shortly after he returned from Swan's Island, where he was consulting on two of the start-ups, both of which are focused on oyster culture. Piconi was assessing an oyster upweller for one and site feasibility for another. One of the operations was started by Jason Joyce and his cousin Josh Joyce, who took part in the program in 2018. Both Joyces are eighth-generation islanders and commercial fishermen who enrolled in the program to consider the benefits while also weighing the costs of starting an oyster farm of their own, the release said. ""Thanks to the program, we took the plunge two years ago and started Swan's Island Oyster Farm,"" said Jason Joyce. ""We'll be putting our oysters on the market this spring, and we couldn't have done it without their help. Our heartfelt appreciation to the Island Institute for their continued guidance in this new business venture."" Aquaculture is considered a natural business expansion for those already working on the water, because of familiarity of working in that environment, the experience of operating a business and the fact it is complementary to lobstering and other marine trades, according to the release. ""Economists, scientists and industry experts predict that Maine's growth potential in aquaculture is significant,"" the release said. ""In 2016, the Gulf of Maine Research Institute found that the Maine oyster industry would triple in size, and the mussel industry would grow six-fold, between 2015 and 2030."" The program focuses on culturing mussels, oysters and seaweed, said Piconi. The start-ups coming out of the program, to date, range along the coast from Eastport to Cape Elizabeth. Participants range in age from early 20s to seasoned lobstermen in their 60s or older. ""This give them the opportunity to diversify their income,"" Piconi said. ""That builds resilience into their communities. ""Our main goal is to support working waterfront and support the people who are already there,"" he said. The program takes participants from set-up through to marketing. The founders of Maine Ocean Farms took part in the 2017 program, developing a farm on Casco Bay that started with 30,000 oysters. They're now growing 150,000 oysters, he said. The focus is on business planning, prolonged one-on-one support services, and networking to help cohort members get started in the water. Features include: training for growing oysters, mussels, and seaweed; knowledge of the state's leasing process and site selection; assistance with developing business and marketing plans; and access to financing and continued business support for the first three years of business operation. Participants also visit established aquaculture businesses and connect with existing aquaculturists and industry experts, allowing them to learn first-hand the ins and outs of running a business like this. This year's cohort will kick off with all-group and individual meetings in April, followed by a two- to three-day aquaculture boot camp where they will receive hands-on training at sea farms in early May. Throughout the summer, participants will receive one-on-one assistance from Island Institute staff as they start their businesses, and the year will round out with several more in-person meetings in the late fall and winter.",good,seaweed aquaculture,2019,Maine
60,9800,New Seaweed Week seeks to expand market | Mainebiz.biz,"A new event, Seaweed Week, is being organized for April 26 through May 4 in Portland to spotlight businesses across greater Portland that champion sea vegetables and challenge others to start innovating with them. The event will be North America's first-ever seaweed-focused restaurant week, according to a news release. It will feature sea greens on menus at eateries, bars, breweries and distilleries. Participants lined up so far include restaurants such as Fore Street and BaoBao Dumpling House; beverage companies like Marshall Wharf Brewing and Maine Craft Distilleries; and consumer products from Akua, Ocean's Balance and Ocean Approved. Other Seaweed Week events include kelp farm tours in Casco Bay, cooking demos, a Fork Food Lab maker competition and a kick-off party at Maine Craft Distilling, showcasing the process behind their seaweed-smoked 50 Stone Whiskey. ""Seaweed checks all the boxes: it's sustainable, nutritious, and tasty,"" the event's organizer, Josh Rogers, said in the release. ""It's one of those intriguing foods that people are curious about, and we're seeing increasing numbers of chefs and product developers experimenting with seaweed."" Seaweed Week is being launched by Rogers and the University of New England, University of Maine Sea Grant, Maine Seaweed Council, Island Institute and Maine Food Strategy, as well as kelp farmers, wild harvesters and value-added producers.  The idea for Seaweed Week emerged as a way to highlight the exploding kelp aquaculture scene in Maine, according to the release. Rogers is the owner of Heritage Seaweed, a retail seaweed shop at 61 India St. in Portland. He told Mainebiz that he got involved with seaweed products when he created a line of seaweed-inspired teas, Cup of Sea. A native Mainer, he was working in New York City at the time, where he spent 12 years as a Google content strategist and a Zagat Restaurant Guide senior editor. That's where he was when he got the idea for seaweed tea, he told Mainebiz. ""I was on a tea break and drinking green tea,"" he said. ""I noticed it tasted exactly like the kelps I was cooking with, that I had been ordering from Maine. So I Googled seaweed tea and it didn't exist."" He put that in the back of his mind, knowing that he wanted to move back to Maine and that, when he did, he wanted to have a career change and get into seaweed products. After he moved back, ""I started small, experimenting in my kitchen with family and friends and iterating on the idea,"" he said. Eventually, he began looking for commercial space to expand production. A friend introduced him to the India Street space, part of an 1800s livery stables complex with a view of Portland's working waterfront. Originally, he had no intention of starting a store. But when he saw the India Street space, ""I was struck with this idea of having a showcase for all these cool products that I had come into contact with,"" he said. He had also returned to the New York Google office to offer a tasting of his tea product. ""I was talking with their event planner about bringing some of my seaweed friends down to do a cooking demo,"" he said. ""She said, 'If we do that, will employees be able to find the ingredients afterward'' I was dumbstruck and said, 'Yes, of course, you can find seaweed anywhere.' But that brought it home to me that seaweed is everywhere, but it's invisible. There's nowhere for anyone to go to find about it, or engage with it."" As a result, he said, his store, which opened July 1, is meant to be a showcase of seaweed products, including his own Cup of Sea.  Since launching the tea, he said, he's learned that many people are interested in seaweed but don't know much about it or how to use it. At the same time, he said, a growing number of chefs are using seaweed as an ingredient. ""I realized what a bummer it was that there are all these chefs doing things with seaweed in Portland and Maine, but no one was talking about it,"" he said. ""Consequently, the public isn't seeking it out. That's the thing with seaweed, it's here but it's kind of invisible."" Enter the idea of Seaweed Week. ""The goal is to raise awareness and demand for Maine seaweeds,"" he continued. ""We have this rapidly growing kelp aquaculture industry. About 10 years ago, there were no seaweed farms in the U.S. Now Maine has well over 100 lease sites. Seaweed is happening. So whatever we can do to get there a little faster and support all the people in Maine who are getting into that business, we want to do that."" The event coincides with the annual kelp harvest, running April 26–May 4; and is designed to build on Portland's reputation as a major foodie destination. Maine has more than 140 lease sites, Jaclyn Robidoux, Marine Extension Associate at the University of Maine's Sea Grant program, said in the release, and Maine leads the nation in the number of seaweed farms, diversity of crops grown, and research and development. Many growers plant kelp alongside other farmed seafoods, such as mussels, oysters and scallops. According to the release, U.S. seaweed retail products increased by 76% between 2011 and 2015 (Food Business News). Rogers said he welcomes more participants in Seaweed Week.

61,9835,American Aquafarms CEO talks about industry's future as wild marine stocks decline | Mainebiz.biz,"American Aquafarms, a Norwegian company that hopes to install a $300 million salmon farm in the waters of Frenchman Bay, recently announced the appointment of Keith Decker the company's CEO, based in the U.S. Decker is a 30-year industry veteran with experience in seafood production and processing, with leadership roles in some of the largest North American seafood companies. He’s a board member and investor in an Oslo, Norway, company that plans to build and operate an industrial scale land-based Atlantic salmon operation outside of Reno, Nev. American Aquafarms proposes to lease 120 acres in Frenchman Bay, between Bar Harbor and Schoodic Peninsula, to install 30 “closed pens” and produce 66 million pounds of salmon annually, and to install a hatchery and processing facility in Gouldsboro. Mainebiz asked Decker what drew him to the firm and about his plans going forward. Here’s an edited transcript. Mainebiz: Where were you up to now' Keith Decker: For 17 years in New Hampshire I ran High Liner Foods, the largest manufacturer of value-added seafood in North America. At the peak, I had seven manufacturing plants and 2,000 employees. Then for the last four years, I was building and running the largest groundfish fishing company on the East Coast, Blue Harvest Fisheries LLC, headquartered in New Bedford, Mass. I’m in the process of moving to Maine.  MB: What drew you to American Aquafarms' KD: A couple of people from American reached out to me.  What I’ve seen through my career is what I believe is the need to onshore our seafood production and rebuild our production capacity on the East Coast and throughout the United States. As a country, we import about 90% of our seafood. Five of the top eight species we consume are farm-raised and, effectively, the majority of it is grown globally and either air-freighted into the United States or put onto container ships to the United States. One thing that’s become really evident, over the last 18 months, is that COVID has exposed our global supply chain problems, not to mention climate change issues of flying seafood to the United States. I’ve been interested in farm-raised salmon, kelp, oysters and other species — I think that’s a fantastic industry that will only continue to grow. MB: How does your skillset working with wild fisheries translate to aquaculture' KD: High Liner Foods is one of the largest seafood importers in North America. I spent quite a bit of time importing and sourcing aquaculture products globally. Being an importer of those products and traveling to those locations, you have an appreciation for the scale of the industry, and also of the challenges of supply chains into the U.S. market.  MB: What’s your vision for American Aquafarms' KD: Assuming we can get the permits, I’d see us building the salmon farm and putting the fish in the water, building a hatchery and a processing plant, and creating a long-term industry and jobs for the working waterfront of Maine. MB: Why is this important' KD: I’ve seen through my career the decline in the natural resources in the Gulf of Maine — groundfish, shrimp and now the lobster catch is declining. The question that should be asked is, what is going to replace those industries and how can that be beneficial to the people who have made their livelihoods with those fisheries for the last hundred years' Knowing that those are very lucrative fisheries that drive tremendous economic opportunities to the state, you’re not going to be able to replace that with small, local aquaculture operations. There has to be some scale.  In the future, if you want to have opportunities for younger people who are growing up — where are they going to work' Do we want an outflow of our talent leaving the state' Or do we want to have good, long-term, well-paying jobs for them' This particular project will produce a few hundred well-paying, long-term jobs. MB: The proposal has substantial local opposition. How do you plan to engage with opponents'  KD: We have started our outreach to address concerns and to work with local communities. Our goal is to provide factual information, go through the rigorous process set up by the state and federal governments when it comes to permitting, but also listen to people in the communities.  At the end of the day, this is going to be a local company that is trying to become part of the community. We want to listen to everyone’s concerns and take them into consideration as much as possible.  MB: Opponents cite expected discharge of 4.1 billion gallons of untreated effluent pumped from the proposed site. What’s your response to that concern' KD: I believe there are currently 24 farms permitted by the state with traditional open pens. We propose bringing the best technology in the world for farming salmon that, I believe, addresses almost every major problem at open sites. It eliminates challenges with algae bloom, oxygenation, disease, sea lice, escapements and waste. We’re going to collect the waste as it falls to the bottom of the pen, which is inside an impermeable membrane bag, pumped to the surface, collected on a barge, dewatered, and turned into biofuel or fertilizer.  As far as 4 billion gallons — we’ll collect more than 90% of the solids, and some of the newer variations are even more efficient.  Go back 50 or 100 years ago. There were massive fish populations in the Gulf of Maine that every day produced effluent. If we have an active healthy fish population, wouldn’t they be producing waste' MB: How do you respond to concerns about views, lights, noise, etc.' KD: We’ve done everything we think is possible to make this as unobtrusive as possible. The pens will only sit 3 feet above the water. We’ve chosen a muted palette. We have done everything in our power to reduce the amount of sounds and light.  MB: And how do you respond to concerns around the risk of fuel spills' KD: No response at this time. MB: Next steps' KD: If we were to get our permits in February, I think we’d be putting fish in the water in the first quarter of 2023. The first harvest would be 2024.",bad,seaweed aquaculture,2021,Maine

63,9844,Go-to-market guide aims to help seafood farmers navigate supply chain challenges | Mainebiz.biz,"The Maine Aquaculture Association on Tuesday released a guide designed to help seafood farmers evaluate distribution channels for their products to best decide how to get them to market. The Maine Aquaculture Distribution Mapping Manual was developed in response to new distribution methods that have emerged over the past two years, including direct-to-consumer sales that have gained in popularity and now serve as an important channel, according to a news release. “As Maine’s working waterfront continues to face new supply chain challenges, the industry and consumer demand keeps growing,” Sebastian Belle, the association’s executive director, said in the release. “By nature, Maine’s farm fishing families are open to navigating choppy waters when they need to. It’s our collective responsibility to support their efforts to bring their product to market.”  For the full report, click here. Maine’s aquaculture industry represents nearly 200 farms and more than 700 farmers who produce premium seafood including fin fish, shellfish and sea vegetables. The sector has been steadily growing in recent years, and its total economic impact has nearly tripled — from $50 million in 2007 to $137 million in 2014 — according to the latest Maine Aquaculture Economic Impact Report.  Across the nation, retail seafood sales were up 35% to $7 billion in 2020 compared to 2019, according to market research company Information Resources Inc. With roughly 80% of all seafood consumed in restaurants nationally, Maine aquaculture producers lost significant markets during the early days of the pandemic as restaurants closed their doors.  More than 20 stakeholders were interviewed to inform the manual, including seafood producers, wholesalers, distributors, restaurateurs, trucking companies and other aquaculture industry members, both in Maine and across the U.S.  The manual, funded in partnership with FocusMaine, puts forth three main recommendations to farmers:  “When the pandemic hit, our distribution chain changed, probably forever,” said Owen Heil, owner of Pound of Tea Oysters and Spartan Sea Farms in Freeport. “We need to be informed about how to navigate shifts in the market to stay in business.”  Heil and his partner Ken Sparta relied on local deliveries to sell their freshly harvested kelp and oysters when the pandemic hit in the spring of 2020. “From online sales to pop-ups and farmer’s markets, there are many routes to distribution,” said Toni Small of Ice House Oysters in Port Clyde.  Small said the manual helps seafood farmers understand the benefits and risks distribution channels. The mapping manual should also help inform a collaborative project underway among the association, the University of Maine School of Economics, Gulf of Maine Research Institute, Island Institute and University of Maine Cooperative Extension. The project, funded via NOAA and Maine Sea Grant, explores in greater detail the costs, volumes, availability and reach of the identified distribution channels, along with consumer preferences for Maine seafood across the U.S. In January, the association and Maine Sea Grant, on behalf of the Maine Aquaculture Hub, released the Maine Aquaculture Roadmap 2022-32, a 10-year plan that proposes four major goals and identifies over $15 million in estimated resources needed to strengthen Maine’s aquaculture sector and working waterfronts.",neutral,seaweed aquaculture,2022,Maine
64,9850,A Maine kelp business on global stage at World Economic Forum in Davos | Mainebiz.biz,"The CEO of a Biddeford kelp processing company had some lessons to share with international business and political leaders at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting, held May 22-26 in Davos, Switzerland. In a session on the ""blue economy,"" Briana Warner discussed how Atlantic Sea Farms' business model and products are driving positive change for people and the planet in the face of climate change. Warner, a 2020 Mainebiz Next list honoree, was invited as one of 20 innovators from around the world to be part of the forum’s UpLink Top Innovator program. ""Davos has long been seen as an annual forum where positive and innovative change can be made, but also as a place where the international elite and the world's largest companies are overrepresented in influencing the global economy in their direction,” she said. “The opportunity to champion a different approach to building food systems in the face of climate change, by putting people and planet first, and by showing how business can be used as a force for good rather than focused purely on profit, was one that I was glad I was able to take.” The World Economic Forum is an international organization committed to improving the state of the world, and holds global strategic summits for leaders to come together to shape a positive future in multiple areas. UpLink is the forum’s network of innovators designed to provide opportunities to help scale and accelerate the impact of their ventures. Warner spoke as part of a panel called “Invest in Blue” along with Ecuador's minister of environment, Gustavo Manrique, and the Coca-Cola Co.’s vice president of global policy and sustainability, Michale Goltzman.  The panel was convened to discuss why supporting ocean health is good for business. Panelists discussed their actions to promote ocean health, focusing on issues including plastic pollution, blue carbon and ocean nature-based solutions for climate.  Atlantic Sea Farms, the first commercial seaweed farm in the U.S., uses regenerative kelp farming to diversify Maine’s coastal economy in the face of climate change, while mitigating some of its effects. Currently working with 27 partner farmers — almost all of whom are lobstermen who farm kelp in their off season from fishing — the company provides free seed and guarantees purchase of all kelp grown. Atlantic this year is on track to harvest more than 1 million pounds of cultivated kelp, which is sold in various forms for chefs, product developers and consumers. “We are working to show the amazing ways that Maine's coastal communities are determining their own future in the face of a dramatically changing planet,” said Warner. During the panel discussion, Warner focused on the idea of systemic change. “I talked about our mission, which is focused on people and planet first,” she said. “I think that’s a divergence from ‘business as usual’ where, for example, people promote the product and then corporate social responsibility is tagged on.” Warner said Atlantic fishermen-partners themselves exemplify responsible business.  “They are making the ocean healthier and adapting to climate change, not because of government subsidies or carbon credits, but because it's the right thing to do for them, for the ocean they have spent generations protecting, and for their children,” she said. She also found encouragement in other companies that, like Atlantic, have people and planet at their core. “It was really inspiring to talk with the other innovators,” she said. For example, she spoke with folks at a company that’s creating a global clearinghouse of academic research on various diseases — “incredibly interesting people who are looking to really disrupt the model of business and ensure that good ethics and good business is at the core of what they do,” she said.",neutral,seaweed aquaculture,2022,Maine
65,9852,Room to grow: How Maine startups find physical space to scale up | Mainebiz.biz,"Physical space is one of the biggest challenges for many startups. While many businesses start out in a garage, basement or spare room, at some point they need dedicated space. A maker of snacks needs a test kitchen to try out recipes. A kelp processor needs space for drying and processing. A packaging startup needs access to a CNC machine. A biotech company needs lab space. A rocket maker needs large areas for building prototypes and a dedicated area for launching. As Briana Warner, CEO of Atlantic Sea Farms, says a move into bigger space is a major step — but often a necessary one as well. The startup recently moved into 27,000 square feet in Biddeford. “[Our old space] was too small. We couldn’t fit the machinery in that we needed to grow. Our new space allows us to continue to grow and serve our customers and be adaptable,” she says. With nearly every startup, at some point there’s a need to find physical space. That’s where a UMaine Innovation Center comes into play, or Tech Place at Brunswick Landing. Here is a look at how some startups solved their space needs. One of the best-known physical spaces is the University of Maine’s Foster Center for Innovation, a leading resource for innovation and commercialization, serving both the campus community and outside businesses and organizations. The base for UMaine programs and services that support entrepreneurship, business development and commercialization of university research. The Foster Center provides courses, training, coaching and consulting to students, faculty and staff, startups and established organizations, helping them develop the skills needed to effectively create, test and actualize ideas. The UMaine campus has been a hotbed of innovation when it comes to offshore wind power, and the Aqua Ventus project; the composite bridge system, called Bridge in a Backpack; and student-led projects like Ferda Farms, an oyster farming initiative. Renee Kelly, an assistant vice president for innovation and economic development at UMaine, serves as a liaison to the state’s economic development community and identifies opportunities for UMaine to partner with organizations to improve Maine’s economy. She also leads the Foster Center, as well as the Maine Innovation Research and Technology Accelerator program, UMaine’s I-Corps Site and business incubation programs. On Brunswick Landing, a former Navy base with an abundance of cavernous buildings, an air strip, aircraft hangars and developable land, TechPlace was a natural place to take root. TechPlace offers affordable space for offices, light industrial use and clean labs. At present it has 38 tenants, or “members,” as it calls them. The members are in spaces that ran from 200 square feet to 3,000 square feet. Some startups there have both office space and industrial space. “We’re 98% full,” says TechPlace director Jaimie Logan. On a recent tour, Logan introduced me to the site’s longest-tenured tenant, Daniel Greisen of Greisen Aerospace, which on a recent day was creating a jig that the Air Force could use to make missile parts. Other tenants with large-scale operations include Nathan Varney, whose VarneyCNC was making composite parts for clients Bath Iron Works and its arch-competitor, Huntington Ingalls Industries, which is based in Newport News, Va. Other businesses at TechPlace run the gamut. Cem Giray is CEO and president of Salmonics, a lab that produces reagents and products such as fibronectin and serums from the unused blood of farmed salmon. Melissa LaCasse, who is an entrepreneur program at the Roux Institute, is developing sustainably produced packaging materials that can be used in place of plastic and styrofoam packaging. Her company, Tanbark Molded Fiber Products, uses TechPlace for storage, with production being tackled in Saco. Running Tide, which is based in Portland and is oyster farming and kelp-raising operations. On a recent day at TechPlace, Josh Hardy of Running Tide was outfitting a shipping container for kelp processing; the container was being readied to go to Iceland. Separately, the team was building a large galvanized steel system for oyster-farming. Jack Quinn, who retired from IDEXX Laboratories and now leads Hound Bio, is doing research related to pet medicines. Clamar Floats produces the pontoons used on float planes. The process looks much like boatbuilding, with large-scale molds and a lot of fiberglass. The floats are shipped all over the world, but many go to Alaska. Unlike some of the more industrial parts of TechPlace, Cassandra O’Brien and Megan Hall work in a clean lab. They work for Loam Bio, which creates products that remove CO2, allowing agricultural uses to have less of an environmental impact. Loam Bio is an Australian company whose U.S. headquarters is in Minneapolis. Ocean Renewable Power Co. produces equipment to harness tidal currents. The firm has a statewide presence. It is headquartered in Portland. It does energy testing in Eastport. It teamed up with Millinocket Fabrication & Machine to manufacture the turbine shafts for its portfolio of products. And its electronics and engineering lab is at TechPlace. BluShift Aerospace’s first dedicated space was a former Navy garage on Brunswick Landing. It was cramped, poorly lit and drafty. “At the time we didn’t need much more than a garage. But it was rudimentary. There was no insulation. We were bundled up. You had to take your gloves off to get anything done,” says Sascha Deri, bluShift’s founder and CEO. At the time, many of the tools the company needed were basic — “95% of them you’d have in the garage at home.” It was hard to beat the rent, which was $300 a month. For larger needs, such as a CNC machine or an industrial-sized lathe, bluShift paid for time at nearby TechPlace, also on Brunswick Landing. For certain projects, bluShift was even able to hire out welders, who were moonlighting from another company. As the startup grew, it needed larger dedicated space, which led it to its current site, at 2 Pegasus St. at Brunswick Landing, an aircraft hangar with a large, heated workshop and office space. “As we’ve grown our engines have grown,” Deri says. Deri says Maine could still benefit by having a large-scale 3D metal printer, an item that could cost $500,000 to $1 million. But an even more pressing need for bluShift is a place to launch the rockets. Jonesport shot down his proposal to launch rockets there. He’s in talks with Steuben, on the Downeast coast, and sent out a request for information with the idea that towns that are open to the aerospace industry might reach out. Ryan Beaumont is a University of Maine-trained engineer and inventor who has designed and built a range of engineering marvels. But when it comes to workspace, he’s been able to set up shop in a wide range of places, often dictated by the physical size of the products he’s engineering. He’s developed large-scale mechanical systems, like production machinery for a paper mill and electrical-and-control systems for a tidal energy project. He’s also been the principal investigator for the R&D and tech transfer for a walking bike and recreation aid for people with balance impairment. In short, he’s worked on large-scale systems and smaller products — all of which have had different space needs. As a result, Beaumont has adapted a flexible approach to his workspace needs. In college, he had access to UMaine’s Foster Innovation Center, which is outfitted with everything from advanced computer programs and CNC machines to workbench space and basic tools. But in recent years, his work is where the workbench is. “I was in Fort Andross in Brunswick. They have units with carpenters, musicians and restaurants. There’s always space available,” he says. “What I really needed was space to lay these things out. I needed rack space, bench space, space to layout and do shipping and receiving.” He then worked out of Tech Place on Brunswick Landing. “That was the right spot for me at the time,” he says, adding that he started working with a manufacturing partner, eliminating the need for larger space. The manufacturing partner, Alexander’s Mechanical Solutions in Bangor, is a full-service job shop, doing everything from machining to welding. With manufacturing being done at a different site, Beaumont, who owns the startup R.M. Beaumont Corp., moved operations back to his Topsham home, outfitting his garage as a workspace for smaller prototypes. “The journey took me back to the garage,” he says. Maine Crisp Co. is, with help from Sheridan Construction, in the process of fitting out 17,500 square feet of dedicated space in Winslow. It’s a $2.4 million fit-out. The company, which produces gluten free chips and was founded by Karen Getz in 2014, has recently been in 1,500-square-feet at Railroad Square in Waterville. But for a number of years Getz was producing Maine Crisp products from her home kitchen — which created some interesting challenges, as she relates. “To start, I had to get the kitchen inspected and certified. As a gluten-free product, we no longer allowed anyone to bring gluten products into our home. As the company grew, I took over most of the kitchen with my ingredients, sheet pans, mixer, slicer and convection oven. It was a constant battle to keep humidity levels down for the crisps,” she says. “We have a back sunroom that stored all of the packaging and cardboard plus a table for packaging crisps. The foyer became the storage area for bulk ordering of ingredients and UPS would pick up daily from the front porch. Oh and an office upstairs!” Even the move into Railroad Square represented a big upgrade. “I baked from home for two years until the Railroad Square space opened up. It was great at first, I barely made a dent in the amount of space, which is about 1,500 square feet. Now we rent additional space down the hall and turned a large room into a cooler room for ingredients. The new space in Winslow is looking great at 17,500 square feet and we expect to move in late July or early August.”",good,seaweed aquaculture,2022,Maine
66,9860,Swimming upstream: First aquaculture apprenticeship program in U.S. launches in Maine  | Mainebiz.biz,"Maine aquaculture is among the most diverse sea farming sectors in the nation, producing more than 25 species of finfish, shellfish and sea vegetable — more than any other U.S. state, according to the Maine Aquaculture Association. In response to the growing industry, workforce development has become a primary focus for the aquaculture industry and, to that end, an apprenticeship program that is the first of its kind in the nation launched this week. The program was formed after the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture awarded a $500,000 grant in January to Portland nonprofit Gulf of Maine Research Institute to develop various aquaculture workforce training programs. Among the ideas were to develop and pilot the Maine Department of Labor's Aquaculture Apprenticeship Program, where participants are expected to gain experience, receive mentoring, get trained and tested on occupational competencies, and learn to use cutting-edge technology at commercial shellfish and sea vegetable farms. The program will provide training for six Maine high school graduates beginning in 2023. It leverages partnerships between Maine Aquaculture Association in Hallowell with Maine aquaculture farms and is supported by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture. Other partners include Educate Maine, the Maine Department of Labor and Southern Maine Community College. Although Maine’s aquaculture industry is small compared with seafood farming elsewhere in the nation and the world, industry experts see opportunities for expansion in various sectors. Over the last 20 years, the industry has grown at an average rate of 2% per year. More than 99% of Maine sea farms are family-owned. This year, Maine’s aquaculture workforce is estimated to include 880 employees across production and related activities, and more than 1,600 across the supply chain. “The Aquaculture Apprenticeship Program is going to springboard Maine high school graduates into fulfilling careers in Maine aquaculture, providing a wonderful opportunity for them to work on the water and for local partner farms to train and hire them,” said Christian Brayden, Maine Aquaculture Association’s project manager who is spearheading the program. Apprentices will complete 2,000 hours of on-the-job training in addition to 144 hours of classroom time at Southern Maine Community College. Skills to be learned on the job include safety protocols, vessel and vehicle operation, maintenance of tools and equipment, shellfish and seaweed production and management, crop and animal husbandry, and food safety.  “We are interested in training an apprentice, with the hope that they would stay on as a long-term member of our team,” said Shey Conover, co-owner of Marshall Cove Mussel Farm of Islesboro. “We have experience hiring and training high school and college students interested in gaining experience on the water, and are able to offer training and opportunities for growth within our company.” Apprenticeship training is distinguished from other types of workplace training by several factors, including paid work experience, classroom instruction, mentorship and a portable, nationally recognized credential.  “Workforce training programs are fundamental to the sustainable growth of the industry,” said Carissa Maurin, the institute’s aquaculture project manager.  Maurin said the program was developed using feedback from Maine’s aquaculture farmers, which helped identify gaps in training programs and create the Maine Aquaculture Workforce Development Strategy, with recommendations for a cohesive aquaculture training system, including an apprenticeship program. Applications are now being accepted for host farms, and high school seniors graduating in 2023 are encouraged to fill out a preliminary interest form.",good,seaweed aquaculture,2022,Maine

68,9868,"Boatbuilders, oyster farmers and kelp growers help preserve working waterfront in Yarmouth  | Mainebiz.biz","Half a dozen years ago, Chad Strater started storing docks at a boatbuilding yard at 123 Even Keel Road on the Cousins River in Yarmouth. The yard was owned by brothers Jamie and Joseph Lowell, whose boatbuilding business, Even Keel Marine Specialties Inc., was rooted in a deep family background in the industry. Strater, a New Gloucester resident, was co-owner of a small marine construction business, Coastal Maine Hardscape. Initially, he and a partner operated out of Freeport, offering landscaping services, then expanding to marine — making, installing, repairing and storing items such as residential docks and piers. “If you needed a spot to store your dock, we’d take it down and tow it to the yard,” he says. In 2017, Strater leased space at the Lowells’ yard, where the brothers also rented to boat shop Greene Marine, a handful of small shellfish farmers and the Yarmouth Rowing Club. Then Jamie and Joe, going their separate ways, decided to sell the yard. The listing drew buyers interested in residential development, say Joe Lowell and his wife Megan. But the brothers wanted someone who would preserve the land as working waterfront. Strater understood the value of working waterfront. “This kind of working space is priceless,” he says. The three got talking. “I can’t remember if they approached me or if I approached them,” says Strater. “I saw the for-sale sign. I said, ‘Wait a minute, this is for sale.’ And they thought that I would be a good candidate to buy it.” Strater looked into conventional lenders and investors for the purchase. No one bit. He continued to talk up the facility with folks in the local maritime industry, eventually meeting Rebecca Rundquist, a Yarmouth resident with extensive experience in the nonprofit world and who worked on the early stages of acquiring the lands that became the Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument. Further research uncovered a U.S. Department of Agriculture Community Facilities loan program offered by Coastal Enterprises Inc. in Brunswick. Eligible borrowers include community-based nonprofits in rural areas. That started the ball rolling to finding like-minded residents and business owners who would agree to form a board of directors to found the nonprofit Sea Meadow Marine Foundation and nailing down the deal in late 2021. A year later, the group is in the midst of plans for a facility that’s seen as vital in the face of Maine’s waning working waterfront. “They’ve been able to clean up the site and bring the existing businesses up to capacity,” says Scott LaFlamme, Yarmouth’s director of economic development. “We’re working with them to figure out potential future uses and talk through what the local planning process might look like.” Sea Meadow Marine is a work in progress and buying the 12-acre property, listed at $1.22 million, was complicated. Significant upgrades are needed — the site lacks sewer and water infrastructure, instead relying on a portable toilet and water that’s trucked in. The goal is to operate the site as a business incubator and marine business hub for early-stage fisheries and sustainable aquaculture businesses alongside marina services, heritage boat builders and recreational marine organizations. Today, tenants support 26 working waterfront jobs in small oyster, kelp, quahog and scallop farm operations, boatbuilding and service companies. Yarmouth Rowing Club uses it as a base of operations. Joe and Megan Lowell rebooted their operation as Downeast Custom Boats. “In order to be able to farm or work in the wild fisheries, people always picture us out on the water,” say Amanda Moeser, a board member and coastal ecologist who owns Lanes Island Oysters elsewhere in Yarmouth. She regularly stops by the Sea Meadow facility to sell product to a dealer. “But we also need a place to park our car, a place to tie up our boat that’s affordable, and a place to land our products,” Moeser says. “Oysters need to be washed and bagged and sorted and sold. So the land-based aspects of farming are so critical. We need places like Sea Meadow Marine because not all of us can afford to own waterfront.” Alicia Gaiero, who’s planting over 100,000 oyster seeds this year for her operation, Nauti Sisters Sea Farm, agrees. Gaiero thinks about access and affordability whenever she’s on the water. “Having that accessibility is a game-changer,” Gaiero says. She estimates a slip at a local marina would cost thousands of dollars each season. “Square-footage for storage can be really expensive,” she continues. “A whole portion of my business plan and budgeting is looking at how much it costs to get on the water. Where do you work' Where do you store your equipment' And Sea Meadow is highlighting the need to preserve other locations.” Strater and other board members have been cleaning the yard and creating useable space. He and a partner, Nick Planson — also a board member — created a new business called the Boat Yard, to provide boat storage and service to workboats and recreational boats, to sell electric motors, and to build electrical charging infrastructure. The board is networking with community and academic organizations to offer access to the working yard and adjacent salt marsh. “Imagine a place where you can park a school bus and spend a day with students and right in front of them there’s a salt marsh and an aquaculture community,” says Thomas Henninger, who operates Madeleine Point Oyster Farms from the site and supplies product to his spin-off business, Freeport Oyster Bar. Henninger says the disappearance of working waterfront to residential development hurts small maritime businesses like his. “Part of being aquaculturalists is having a social contract,” he says. “I’m growing my oysters because the state leased me an area. I don’t think that’s one-sided. That social contract with the community, for an oysterman, happens when someone’s kid is on your farm, when schoolkids visit your upweller where you grow the baby oysters, when someone brings their kayak down.” Explaining the project to the public can be difficult. “It’s really hard for people to understand why we’re a nonprofit,” Strater notes. “They say, ‘It’s a boatyard. What’s nonprofit about that'’ As a nonprofit, it enabled us to receive the funding to purchase the property and provide affordable waterfront access.” In order to get that USDA loan, though, Strater first had to prove the facility could generate a revenue stream. The listing broker, Kirk Butterfield of KW Commercial Group at Keller Williams Realty, came up with a creative strategy that would allow Strater to develop the nonprofit and simultaneously pursue the loan, along with an operating grant from the Elmina B. Sewall Foundation in Freeport. Butterfield worked out a master lease and a leaseback. The arrangement meant Strater could lease the property from the Lowells, then act as the landlord and lease space to aquaculture operators and other tenants — including the Lowell brothers — even though he didn’t yet own the property. With that arrangement, which took effect in 2020, Strater could demonstrate to the lending agent that he had the income stream necessary to make the numbers work. “It was a pretty good rate, but it’s definitely money that we have to pay back,” says Strater. “So we have to make sure that we’re monetizing that property correctly so that it will stay as it is.” Simultaneously, Strater and others formed a volunteer board of directors who acted as loan guarantors. Strater and Rundquist credit U.S. Sen. Angus King’s office for expediting the foundation’s nonprofit status, allowing it to finalize the purchase before its agreement with the Lowells expired and the finance arrangement became void. He adds, “Lots of people and entities worked together to make this happen.” Board members have diligently cleared yard debris and organized boat storage to maximize space. Average onlookers will still see old buildings. The timeframe and budget for hooking up sewer and water are unclear. “It’s hard because it looks like we haven’t done anything,” says Rundquist. “If you go down there, it doesn’t show all the work we’ve been doing, because a lot of it is planning and conversations.” GEI Consultants Inc. in Portland is developing a site plan as a collaborative process with the facility’s users. “We have to have something that everyone needs and that’s not too much for the site,” Strater says. “We know it’s not the right place for a big industrial facility. And we like the small-scale community that we have now.” Gaiero speaks to that community feel. An aquaculture cooperative formed at the site bought a storage container and converted it into a refrigerated reefer approved to hold shellfish. A dock and equipment were added. Gaiero doesn’t have her own fixed facility, which limits how she sells product on her own. “The coop acts as your shellfish dealer, which is huge,” she says. Gaiero isn’t a coop member, but “The industry is small and like a family,” she says. If another farmer is unloading oysters from their harvest, she’ll go down and help them. “That camaraderie is pretty common,” she says. The project coincides with the town’s interest in fostering aquaculture opportunities, in assessing industry need for working waterfront access, and in understanding how the town can mitigate regulatory or spatial constraints on sector growth, says LaFlamme. “Continued growth at the site will involve public infrastructure improvements that will go through enhanced planning board review,” he says. Rundquist notes that developing the site as a community asset is not just for Yarmouth. “We’re trying to make a model for all communities that are losing their working waterfronts,” she says. Henninger adds, “This is ours to create and we need to create it the right way.” For Joe Lowell, it’s simple: “I’m so glad this place is still working waterfront.” In 2021, an Island Institute report, “The Critical Nature of Maine’s Working Waterfront and Access to the Shore,” made these findings.",good,seaweed aquaculture,2023,Maine
69,9873,Aquaculture trainees learn the ropes in summer programs | Mainebiz.biz,"New aquaculture apprenticeship and pre-apprentice programs are getting clear signals that the industry is on to something when it comes to recruiting and training workforce. This summer, 19 pre-apprentices are working on 18 aquaculture farms along the coast. And people have moved from as far as California and Alaska, including former commercial fishermen, to enroll in the apprentice program. The programs are a collaboration of FocusMaine, Educate Maine, Gulf of Maine Research Institute and Maine Aquaculture Association. The two experiential learning programs aim to create a career pathway into Maine’s aquaculture sector.  “These new, certified aquaculture apprenticeship programs are a result of years of accomplishments steadily building upon each other through the power of partnerships and strategic efforts and investments,” said Andrea Maker, co-chair of FocusMaine.  The pre-apprentice training opportunities are called Aquaculture Pioneers, launched in 2022 with grant support from the Builders Initiative, a Chicago-based firm.  The program connects pre-apprentices with employers along Maine’s coast for 10 to 12 weeks of mentored and paid work at an aquaculture farm, hatchery or business. The program reimburses employers for the cost of the pre-apprentice wages. Perks for participants include a two-day bootcamp led by sector leaders that includes introductory boat safety and knot-tying training as well as participation in Maine Career Catalyst, a summer professional development program,  and a ticket to the Annual Student Symposium for the Advancement of Maine’s Blue Economy.  “Pre-apprenticeship and registered apprenticeship programs provide workers with unique opportunities to discover and explore the aquaculture sector in a structured, experiential way,” said Kate Howell, Director of Workforce Partnerships at Educate Maine. “Individuals can participate regardless of whether they’ve previously been in the industry.” Madeleine Point Oyster Farm in Yarmouth joined Aquaculture Pioneers as an employer partner this year.  “Our farm has benefited tremendously from hosting a pre-apprentice through the Aquaculture Pioneers program,” said the company’s founder, Thomas Henninger.  Michael Scannell, a pre-apprentice working this summer at Madeleine Point, said the hands-on experience has had a huge impact on him. “It’s exciting to see all of the ventures popping up within my home state, which makes me feel like I don’t have to travel far in order to find a career on the water,” Scannell said. The pre-apprenticeship is connected to an apprenticeship program, for shellfish and seaweed farming, that launched this spring. Sponsored by the Maine Aquaculture Association in partnership with the Gulf of Maine Research Institute and Educate Maine with funding support from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture, the 2,000-hour paid apprenticeship program offers Maine Department of Labor certified apprenticeships at five farms across the midcoast and southern Maine.  Over a span of one year, apprentices gain industry-specific skills through on-the-job learning/mentorship and 144 hours of classroom education at Southern Maine Community College.  Learning outcomes include organizational and safety protocols; vessel and vehicle operation; use and maintenance of tools and equipment; shellfish and seaweed production, management, and health, and food safety and regulation. “Apprentices, including former commercial fishermen, have moved from as far as California and Alaska to capitalize on this first-of-its-kind opportunity to build a career in aquaculture in Maine,” said  Christian Brayden, project manager at Maine Aquaculture Association.  The program was designed using occupational standards for aquaculture training providers, developed by  an earlier collaboration designed and sponsored by FocusMaine between Gulf of Maine Research Institute, Maine Aquaculture Association and Educate Maine.  “The occupational standards have received high praise for setting the first standard in U.S. aquaculture,” said Brayden. “They are being reproduced and implemented in states with aquaculture across the country, where they will serve as guides for further workforce development.” Similarly, the Maine Aquaculture Workforce Development Strategy, an analysis that documents current and future labor needs of Maine’s developing aquaculture sector, charted the course for Maine to establish a comprehensive workforce training system. ""The launch of the aquaculture apprenticeship and pre-apprenticeship programs are a pivotal milestone that aligns with and realizes the goals outlined in the Maine Aquaculture Workforce Strategy,” said Carissa Maurin, GMRI's aquaculture program manager.",neutral,seaweed aquaculture,2023,Maine
70,9878,"Four-wheel drive, food runs: What it takes to build a $2M research center on Hurricane Island | Mainebiz.biz","The Hurricane Island Center for Science and Leadership cut the ribbon earlier this month on a new field research station. The center, a science and education nonprofit established in 2009, conducts marine science research, hosts visiting researchers, and offers experiential education programs for young people. It's located on 125-acre Hurricane Island, part of the Fox Islands Archipelago in Penobscot Bay, about 12 miles offshore from Rockland. The new field research station is one of only two in the Gulf of Maine. The goal is to serve as a state-of-the art science facility and a hub to connect local students, teachers, scientists, community leaders and fishermen in shared efforts to better understand the marine environment. “We’re really uniquely situated here to increase the capacity to do marine sustainability science and education that really makes a difference to Maine,” said Richard Wahle, a University of Maine marine biologist. In the last decades of the 19th century, Hurricane Island quarries were an important source of granite, according to ""Hurricane Island — The Town that Disappeared"" by Eleanor Motley Richardson and published by the Island Institute in Rockland. Labor was provided by European immigrants, who established a small town on the island. The last shipment of giant blocks sank in heavy seas in 1914. A man named William Gaston bought the island when the bank that held it went into receivership in 1936. He later deeded it to his son, James Gaston, who eventually built a summer home there. From 1964 to 2006 Hurricane Island was a summer base camp for Outward Bound, an outdoor organization that conducts adventure-based courses. The Hurricane Island Outward Bound base camp was founded by Peter Willauer. Now headquartered in Camden, the Hurricane Island Outward Bound School continues its nonprofit educational mission. And the Gaston family still owns Hurricane Island. Willauer went on to establish the Hurricane Island Center for Science and Leadership in 2009. In 2012, the organization ran its first six programs serving 86 participants.  This year, the organization is scheduled to deliver 5,444 program days to 987 students and 565 adults. It has 14 year-round and 25 seasonal employees. Within that group, there are four year-round and four seasonal research staff. In addition to serving local schools and the community, the organizations annually hosts 60 to 70 young adult leaders from 30 countries on six continents who plan sustainability initiatives for their home communities while training at Hurricane Island.  That program is a partnership with United People Global and has grown to virtually engage over 700 young adult leaders from 130 countries since its inception in 2019.  Over the past six years, Executive Director Bo Hoppin has moved the organization from an annual budget of just over $1 million to this year’s budget of $2.7 million. Hurricane provides experiential, hands-on education programs and research opportunities focused on marine sciences, STEM education, human ecology, sustainable living technology, citizen science initiatives, and leadership. Its programs reach public and private middle and high school students and teachers, college and university students, graduate researchers, undergraduate interns, amateur naturalists, scientists, sustainable engineers and volunteers. Facilities today include a galley and mess hall as the campus hub. A laboratory is full of field research equipment. A multipurpose space houses classrooms and a library. Restrooms consist of composting toilets. An infirmary is equipped with wilderness medical kits and beds, and staff are certified in wilderness first aid. Housing includes five cabins for 22 people, a bunkhouse and wall tents for 24 people each, and yurts for 10  people. Electricity comes from 24 solar panels and a battery bank. Water from a quarry pond is pushed by a solar pump, treated by an ultrafiltration unit and by chlorination, stored in 500-gallon tanks and gravity-fed to the galley, shower house and composting toilet building. A propane on-demand hot water heater provides backup heat. A wetland was constructed in 2013 for treatment and dispersal of graywater. Gardens produce flowers and fresh produce. There’s a greenhouse and composting. Waterfront facilities include a dockhouse, piers, boat supplies, life jackets, research equipment, boats and moorings. The organization holds a demonstration lobster license for research purposes. The organization also manages a 3.2-acre aquaculture site. The organization’s board of directors began considering the feasibility of constructing a marine field research station in 2014. By 2017, construction began to reinforce the pilings and pier at the site. Opal Architects in Belfast was contracted two years later to design the facility. Ground was broken in 2021.  Opal Architects’ sister firm, Opal Build, constructed modular high-efficiency panels, delivered them to the island and assembled them to make a passive house envelope.  Additional work included erecting posts and beams, installing exterior siding and a metal roof, performing interior finish work and adding a staircase. Gawler & Daughters Sheet Metal Roofing Co. in Belgrade performed the roof work. The shore-based facility is designed to serve as a “visual epicenter” for the organization’s mission and sustainable campus, and to increase capacity for year-round research in Penobscot Bay.  The structure has been completed, but the building remains to be fully equipped. Among the major systems to be installed is plumbing for indoor flowing seawater tanks, which allow scientists and students to interact with species in a controlled environment a few hundred yards from the island’s experimental aquaculture site where scallops, kelp, mussels, oysters and other specimens can be grown or collected from the wild. Additional installations will be a dry room and teaching space.  The passive-house envelope is designed to minimize power consumption for the solar micro-grid that powers the campus, keeping emission and environmental impact to a minimum. Opal's sister company, Madison-based TimberHP, helped secure European wood fiber insulation board for use on the exterior of the building. (TimberHP is selling its domestically manufactured loose fill insulation, TimberFill, and will soon add wood fiber batt and board insulations to the products being made in Madison.) “When you take the wood fiber insulation and the cross-laminated timber, you’re talking about an all-wood construction which is renewable, recyclable and carbon storing with a negative carbon footprint when we build that building,” said Matt O'Malia, Opal's executive partner.  The total construction cost, including equipping the facility and installing the flowing seawater system, is expected to be $2,081,660. Initial funding came from a $250,000 one-to-one challenge gift from the Alan Lewis Pinnacle Leadership Foundation, received in 2019. After meeting the challenge, additional funds were raised through individual gifts and foundation grant support.  To date, the organization has secured $1,384,964, which includes $649,964 from individual gifts and $735,000 comes from foundation grants and pledges. Foundation support includes grant funding from: According to the organization, the facility fills a need from the scientific community for an offshore marine lab and sampling site as water temperatures and other measurable variables continue to change in the waters of the Gulf of Maine.  Once completed, the station is expected to: Building the research station and this year’s hiring of a new research director, Anya Hopple, represents a commitment to further the organization’s research mission, said Hoppin. That includes the organization’s own research work, which today is primarily focused on scallop aquaculture but is expected to expend under Hopple’s leadership. Another goal is to attract more outside researchers. “We’re very much emerging,” Hoppin said.  The island’s geographic location, he said, “is a unique opportunity to study a body of water that’s in the 99th percentile of global warming,” making the research station an opportunity for scientists to use as a jumping-off point for their research sites, then return to process their results.  Hopple, a biogeochemist who most recently worked for the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center, said a goal is to transition the island’s research presence from seasonal — currently operating form March through November — to year-round.  Logistics for living on the island can be complicated. There’s a weekly food run when the organization sends a boat to Rockland to meet a delivery truck and pick up odds and ends at local stores. Upon returning to the island, “It’s an all-staff effort,” said Hoppin with a laugh. “The staff heads to the dock and we make a people chain from the boat to the landing.” From the landing, supplies are loaded into a four-wheel-drive solar-powered electric vehicle and taken to the mess hall. Once in a while, there’s an extra run to a market on the nearby island of Vinalhaven. Materials to build the field station came on about 15 trips made by a barge supplied by Island Transporter LLC in Rockland.  “The landing craft lands, the vehicles with the materials come off, they’re quickly offloaded, and they go back on the transporter and back to the mainland,” Hoppin said. The transporter also brought heavy equipment such as a crane and lift.  Hoppin credited Opal Build employees for embracing island life. “They’d usually come on the ferry run on Monday and they’d stay usually until Thursday, and work 10- to 12-hour days,” he described. “We have a dinner circle every night with all the students, and they’d sit with them.” Construction is about 75% complete. The next phase will include installation of the flowing seawater lab, the first-story panel siding, solar power system, and equipping the facility with scientific and educational fixtures and supplies. The goal is to complete the work this fall and be operational by next spring, said Hoppin. “We’re on a tremendous growth trajectory in general,” he said.",neutral,seaweed aquaculture,2023,Maine
71,9882,Meeting fails to quell salmon farm concerns - The Ellsworth AmericanThe Ellsworth American,"GOULDSBORO — American Aquafarms last week once again made a case for its $330 million project to raise Atlantic salmon off Bald Rock and Long Porcupine Island and process the fish at the now dormant Maine Fair Trade Lobster Co. facility in Prospect Harbor. But the Norwegian-backed company’s June 23 presentation did little to quell citizens’ fears that the proposed operation will harm the area’s robust lobster fishery and scenic values that draw millions of visitors to the region annually.  At the Maine Department of Marine Resources’ 3.5-hour scoping session, held via Zoom, American Aquafarms heard comments and answered questions about its proposal and draft applications to lease the two Frenchman Bay sites for up to 20 years. The intent, too, was for the company to inform the public about its proposed plan to harvest as much as 66 million pounds of salmon annually from the two 15-pen sites and process the fish at the Prospect Harbor facility. Sardines, lobster and other seafood have been processed almost continuously at that facility and transported to market from there for at least 115 years. Attending the Zoom session, Acadia National Park Superintendent Kevin Schneider had a prepared statement to read aloud, but he was not among the 13 people who got to speak during the allotted time. In his statement, made public June 24, Schneider called for the DMR’s July deadline for submitting written comments on the long-term leases to be extended to Aug. 6. In his remarks, he noted that Acadia National Park is just 2,000 feet at the closest point from the two lease sites each comprising 60.32 acres. At both sites, two rows of eight and seven closed pens would be arranged in grids and anchored to the ocean floor in mooring systems encompassing 10 acres each. Since 1916, Schneider said Acadia has strived to protect the region’s scenic qualities and natural and cultural resources from Schoodic Point to the East Penobscot Bay shipping channel near Isle au Haut. ANP owns 2,700 acres or half of that offshore island. He said the park “encourages compatible adjacent land uses” and actively engages in local, state, tribal and federal regulatory processes to lessen potential adverse impacts on the park. In the Frenchman Bay area, he said commercial fisheries and existing aquaculture have not posed a threat until now. In 2019, Acadia’s visitors contributed $511 million to the regional economy and provided 5,500 jobs to people living within 60 miles of the park.  “The scale of this development — the equivalent of 16 football fields — is unprecedented in Maine and incongruous with the existing nature and setting of Frenchman Bay and its surrounding lands,” the park superintendent commented, saying American Aquafarms’ proposed operation poses potentially significant impacts to Acadia and its visitors’ experience.  Frenchman Bay fishermen Shane Carter, Josh Duym and James Hanscom also took issue with the project’s scale as well as potential fishing gear conflicts in Frenchman Bay, which is 7 miles across at its widest point, stretching from eastern Mount Desert Island to the western Schoodic Peninsula shore. In the inlet, the high-speed CAT (when it resumes service), another seasonal ferry, numerous fishing vessels, tour boats and pleasure craft already coexist and lobster gear conflicts already occur from time to time. At present, lobster, mussels, scallops and sea urchins are harvested in the bay. Oysters and various species of seaweed are farmed there, too, on a small scale. “Our bay was never meant to be industrialized,” said Hanscom, a lobster fisherman from Bar Harbor. Elizabeth Ransom, senior project manager at Ransom Consulting Engineers and Scientists in Portland, responded to the lobstermen’s concerns about both the Bald Rock and Long Porcupine sites’ locations in prime fishing grounds. Her firm conducted much of the field work and computer modeling and statistical analysis behind the sites’ selection and in drawing up the draft DMR and Maine Department of Environmental Protection applications. Since a few meetings with fishermen last fall, Ransom told the lobstermen that the Long Porcupine site’s layout has been changed from a rectangular grid, consisting of two rows of eight and seven pens aligned side-by-side, to an L-shaped configuration to better accommodate boat traffic nearby. More importantly, she said the Long Porcupine site’s original location has been moved much farther north and away from the “The Hop,” a deep basin favored by lobster and spawning shrimp, where Hancock, Lamoine, Sorrento and South Gouldsboro lobstermen set a lot of traps.  “We encouraged American Aquafarms to move farther and farther away from The Hop,” Ransom said during the scoping session. When asked the next day, she said the Long Porcupine site is now 300 feet farther to the northeast. In addition, Ransom said the Bald Rock site location has been adjusted, too, in response to fishermen’s concerns. She said that lease area has been moved about 750 feet north and 300 feet west away from active fishing grounds.  Critics also have questioned American Aquafarms’ plan for its vessels to travel at least an hour from Prospect Harbor — rounding Schoodic Point — to reach its Frenchman Bay operation. They pointed out the travel time would take too long to respond to an urgent situation at either site. In season, they also noted the Schoodic Peninsula shoreline is dotted with lobster buoys and damage to fishing gear would be unavoidable.  During the session, American Aquafarms Vice President Eirik Jors said the company “is open and willing to adjust routes based on requests and feedback from fishing and local communities.” Later on, company officials said they are looking, but haven’t secured yet a “secondary” mainland departure point to cut the travel time and reach the pens in less than 30 minutes, according to the draft DMR lease applications.  To tend the Bald Rock and Long Porcupine sites, American Aquafarms would use the 140-foot vessel Mar Fortune (499 tons) to transport juvenile fish, feed, diesel fuel and oxygen tanks there from the company’s planned processing/hatchery complex in Prospect Harbor. At each site, a feed/processing barge would be equipped with a generator and stainless-steel tanks to store waste, diesel and oxygen. The barges also would have a hazardous waste storage unit on board. Harvesting would take place there three to six days per week year-round. On alternating days, the sites’ salmon would be harvested within about a three-hour period. Two crews of 8 to 10 people would take turns tending the pens during daylight hours. An automated system would feed the fish throughout the day. At each site, seawater would be pumped up into the pens from an ocean depth of 100 feet. Oxygen is constantly added to the inflowing water. Fish waste is continuously pumped up, filtered and compacted for transport to the mainland. Shipped from Searsport, low-sulfur marine oil would power the sites although solar energy options are being explored. Running 356 days a year, the sites would burn over 1 million gallons of diesel fuel annually.  Bar Harbor resident Jim O’Connell charged that American Aquafarms’ operation would violate “land-based” air emission standards. The public can continue to register their comments either online or in writing about American Aquafarms’ draft DMR applications until 5 p.m. Wednesday, July 7. Comments may be sent electronically via https://www.maine.gov/dmr/aquaculture/index.html or by mail to the DMR in Augusta no later than 5 p.m. July 7.

72,9896,"In the land of lobster, seaweed finding niche - The Ellsworth AmericanThe Ellsworth American","ELLSWORTH — The annual Maine harvest of seaweed pales in comparison to lobster landings in pounds and value. Yet increasingly, lobstermen have joined other entrepreneurs in growing, harvesting and marketing Maine seaweed. Seen as another means of diversifying the state’s commercial fishing industry, it is turning into a multimillion-dollar industry and keeping in-shore fishermen busy during lobster’s off season. Rockweed, common along the Maine coast, accounts for about 95 percent of commercially harvested seaweed. It’s used for packing lobsters, as fertilizer and a nutritional additive for pet and livestock feed, and to extract alginate, used to thicken foods, cosmetics and even paint. But a smaller but growing market is for kelp, sugar kelp, dulse and Alaria, edible sea vegetables grown and harvested for nutritional and flavor supplements in a variety of foods. “People are recognizing its health benefits, its environmental benefits, and it tastes great,” Island Institute’s Sam Belknap said. The institute recently supported new aquaculturists, including seaweed growers, in a program for fishermen. “You plant it in the fall and harvest it in the spring,” Belknap said. “It really captures that down time the fishermen who aren’t fishing offshore have. And it leverages the gear they already use.” Sea vegetables are finding their way into an increasingly wide range of products. They are key ingredients in Gott’s Island-based Dulse & Rugosa skincare products. Fogtown Brewing Co. in Ellsworth adds it to special beers. Springtide Seaweed in Gouldsboro sells sea vegetable-based products, along with supplies, seeds and consulting services. In Hancock, Maine Coast Sea Vegetables offers kelp crunch bars, along with sugar kelp, Alaria (similar to Japanese wakame) and dulse along with other seaweed products. Founder Shep Erhart and General Manager Seraphina Erhart noted that before starting the business and as followers of a macrobiotic diet, “our purchase of imported seaweeds were a large part of our budget, but we quickly realized they didn’t need to be.” The company started long before the nation’s current level of interest in sea vegetables, and now works with independent suppliers, “many of whom we’ve worked with for decades,” the Erharts said. And because the company began decades ago, it used “a little bit of family seed money and a whole lot of Downeast Maine bootstrapping,” they noted, although its new facility received some assistance from Maine Manufacturing Partnership and the Small Business Administration. About 30 seaweed farmers dot the coastline from Biddeford and eastward up the coast. One of the fastest-growing companies is Atlantic Sea Farms in Saco, started in 2009 and the U.S.’s first commercial seaweed farm. In October, it announced $3.1 million in new investment funding and plans a new processing facility in Biddeford. Like Maine Coast Sea Vegetables, CEO Briana Warner also uses a string of independent harvesters. The Erharts sees these “small, sustainable farms run by existing fishermen,” along with wild seaweed harvesting, as the future of the local seaweed industry, at least in the short term. “Big farms, like is the norm in Asia, is not the answer here,” she said. “We need to continue to be a responsible fishery, good neighbors with our farm locations and diversify what is being grown amongst the native species.” With 95 percent of edible seaweed products imported to the U.S., and the edible seaweed market on the rise, Maine harvesters are poised to take advantage. And while lobster prices are at their highest in 2021, future-looking fishermen and the organizations that support a healthy Maine working waterfront are investing time, research and money into seaweed. Aquaculture, in general, has broad government support in Maine, as seen in a federal and state-funded 1990 report, “An Aquaculture Development Strategy for the State of Maine.” The reasons behind the push echo the situation today: demand for seafood is high and getting higher while supplies in some fisheries are declining; there are new technologies in aquaculture, and Canada, the largest exporter of seafood, especially to the U.S., is heavily investing in aquaculture. Thirty years after that 1990 report, a large-scale salmon aquaculture operation is proposed — with strong community pushback — in the waters off Mount Desert Island. A land-based salmon farm has already been approved but not yet started at the former site of the Bucksport paper mill on the Penobscot River. But unlike farmed finfish, seaweed aquaculture is regenerative, meaning it does not require fresh water, pesticides or antibiotics, and actually improves ocean conditions by removing carbon and nitrogen from the water column. The economic rise of seaweed is mirrored in the amount harvested statewide and the money it brings in. In 2016, just under 17.5 million pounds of seaweed “landed” brought in $616,578 of value, according to data provided by the Maine Department of Marine Resources. But in 2020, while landings dropped to 16.2 million pounds, its value was just under $1.1 million, roughly 40 percent higher than in 2016. “What we have seen happening around the globe was a growing interest in seaweed aquaculture. And Maine has already had aquaculture for 40 or 50 years,” said Paul Anderson, executive director of the Maine Center for Coastal Fisheries in Stonington and a former director of the University of Maine at Orono’s Sea Grant program. How and if seaweed will fit in and complement the lobster fishing industry remains to be seen, Anderson noted. “Lobstermen have a pile of concerns going on right now. In all reality, lobsters are going to continue to move northward,” he said. “Will lobstermen adopt this practice' Are any of them early adapters' Not in Stonington, they’re not.”",good,seaweed aquaculture,2021,Maine

This U.S. Department of Agriculture grant will build on the efforts of the SEAMaine, industry-led initiative of leaders in Maine’s commercial fishing, aquaculture and seafood economy,” which has been funded with support by Senators Susan Collins and Angus King. “Small businesses are the backbone of Maine’s economy, and helping them to reach their full potential strengthens Maine’s economy and creates new employment opportunities, particularly in our rural communities,” Senators Collins and King said in a joint statement Thursday.  “We welcome this investment from the USDA, which will allow Springtide Seaweed to develop new seaweed crops, increasing sustainability and efficiency in the industry, diversifying the aquaculture industry, and supporting jobs in coastal communities.” The potential of U.S. seaweed aquaculture is immense, but the industry remains stalled at low-value brown kelp crops. Springtide Seaweed will use this funding to refine its nursery technologies and designs for efficient seed production of high-value nori and dulse red seaweed.  This cultivation system would be used by the South Gouldsboro-based company and commercialized for aquaculture businesses globally.  New turnkey systems, adaptable to red and brown seaweed cultivation, will increase sustainability in the industry, reduce gear and crop failure, and enable high-value red seaweeds to be easily integrated into existing aquaculture industries, including shellfish, finfish, and seaweed farms worldwide. This funding was awarded through the Small Business Innovation Research Program at the USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture.  This program encourages the growth of domestic small businesses by offering competitively awarded grants to support high-quality research related to important scientific problems and opportunities in agriculture.

75,9929,Governor visits Schoodic area - The Ellsworth AmericanThe Ellsworth American,"WINTER HARBOR — Governor Janet Mills paid a visit to the Schoodic Peninsula July 21, making stops in Gouldsboro, Prospect Harbor and Winter Harbor to speak to residents. Deirdre McArdle, executive director and founder of the Winter Harbor Music Festival, was one of the organizers of this visit. “It offers the Governor a chance to see what people in the community are thinking, hear what local people have to say,” McArdle said. Other organizers of the visit include Vicki and Alan Goldstein, who serve on the board of directors of the Schoodic Institute, Robert Nichols, who recently opened Downeaster Coffee, Artistry, and Community in Winter Harbor, and Becky O’Keefe, who gardens and paints in the Schoodic area. “We all have the same sort of vision for her [Governor Mills] to come to the community and talk to people,” McArdle said. Mills began her visit in Gouldsboro, starting at the Springtide Seaweed Farm. She then moved on to the Gouldsboro Clam Lab, which works in conjunction with the Pathways program at Sumner Memorial High School and is in the process of reseeding clam flats that have been devoid of clams for decades. At U.S. Bells in Prospect Harbor, she was given a ship’s bell as a surprise gift and a Schoodic souvenir. “True ingenuity and work ethic combined to make a beautiful product,” said Mills after receiving her bell. Dick Fisher, owner of U.S. Bells, presented Mills with the bell before discussing with her his concerns about a proposed salmon farm in Frenchman Bay. “The process of raising the fish gives off nitrogen in the bay which does not flush; contrary to what American Aquafarms claims it will not flush out of the bay, it’ll keep accumulating more and more,” said Fisher. “It will never be the same.” “We have a process, and the DMR has rejected their application on objective grounds,” Mills said. “I know that they’re [Department of Marine Resources] taking a dive into the issue and they made a decision that they won’t accept the application at this point.” Mills said that there were issues that the developers would need to resolve if another application came forward. “They don’t have an egg source,” Mills said. “Impact on marine fisheries in the area, impact on pre-existing fisheries, that’s a huge hurdle, I suspect.” After her visit to U.S. Bells, the Governor made her way to Winter Harbor, where she visited the businesses on Main Street, and spoke with some business owners and local residents.

77,9974,Local seaweed flexes in plant-based foods | Waterfront | ellsworthamerican.com,"Local seaweed, such as dulse and sugar kelp, is showing up in plant-based foods.  Waterfront Reporter Local seaweed, such as dulse and sugar kelp, is showing up in plant-based foods. ELLSWORTH — Maine seaweed is staking its place in the plant-based foods market. Meatless meat — otherwise known as plant-based meat — now claims cooler space in most grocery store meat departments, buoyed by high COVID-era prices, consumer choice and a positive media buzz. Seafood, too, now comes in plant-based versions on a smaller but growing scale. And local seaweed is part of the ingredient mix. “We definitely have wholesale customers that purchase our seaweed,” said Kara Ibarguen, who handles wholesale accounts for Maine Coast Sea Vegetables in Hancock. “We really don’t know of all the various products that may contain our seaweed, since we sell our seaweeds to ingredients distributors.” However, Good Seed Burger, and meal kit companies Hello Fresh and Green Chef all use their products, whether dulse, sugar kelp or Sea Seasonings Kelp Blend Granules, as do Ellsworth’s Provender Kitchen + Bar and Fogtown Brewing Company. There are dozens of plant-based meat companies in the U.S. and currently at least a dozen producing “seafood” from various ingredients such as peas, soy and vegetable protein, chickpea and lentil flour — and seaweed grown by kelp farmers from Eastport to Stockton Springs and beyond. “People want that umami taste you can’t get from other ingredients,” said Briana Warner, CEO and founder of Atlantic Sea Farms in Biddeford. She sources kelp from farmers up and down the Maine coast, with more than 50 percent of kelp harvested from Midcoast to Downeast harvesters. Atlantic Sea Farms supplies kelp for plant-based meatballs and burgers launched by Massachusetts-based seafood supplier North Coast Seafoods and for Mind Blown scallops and shrimp. It’s a market Warner actively sought out and she’s happy with the results. “They taste great,” she said of Mind Blown products. “I’m an active seafood eater and I really like the mouth feel.” The market is there for plant-based seafood. Consumer intelligence firm NeilsenIQ recently reported an increase in interest from consumers for plant-based “alternatives” in 2023, whether meat, dairy or seafood. But plant-based alternatives represent only a tiny portion of seafood sales. Retail sales in 2022 for plant-based seafood accounted for an estimated 0.2 percent of the U.S. packaged seafood market in dollar sales, compared to the 2.5 percent of plant-based meat sales of total meat sales, according to research by Good Food Institute, a nonprofit organization that advances alternative proteins. With packaged seafood an $8.5 billion business in the U.S., that tiny percentage represents $17 million of product sold, with some small piece of the pie going to local seaweed producers and harvesters. “The pleasant surprise is more about the general awareness and increase in plant-based foods in every grocery store,” Ibarguen said. “It’s no longer just a specialty item found in a few locations (as it was when we started 50 years ago). Sort of a plant-based foods version of ‘a rising tide lifts all boats,’ if you will.”",good,seaweed aquaculture,2023,Maine

80,10042,Seaweed Festival riding a wave as cooking with seaweed grows in popularity - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram,"Open It's the second year for the South Portland festival, which drew 1,500 people last year. Not long ago, scientists from Oregon State University announced they had grown and patented a new strain of dulse, a succulent red seaweed that tastes like bacon when it’s fried. Using the B-word guaranteed that the story would soon go viral and zoom around the Internet. THIS YEAR’S Maine Seaweed Festival will be held from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Aug. 29 at Southern Maine Community College. Expect a seaweed parade, lectures on kelp farming, art workshops on topics such as seaweed pressing, children’s activities, chef demos and the Full Moon Fishery Feast – a ticketed dinner in which every course features seaweed. ANDREA OLSEN, a professor of dance and environmental studies at Middlebury College in Vermont, will perform “Dancing in Wild Places: Seaweed and Ocean Health.” AND THE FESTIVAL will host the Maine debut of a new documentary about Rachel Carson called “The Power of One Voice.” “Oh my word, I can’t stand that article. It makes me crazy,” said Sarah Redmond, a seaweed expert at Maine Sea Grant in Franklin. “Maine Coast Sea Vegetables started selling seaweeds way back in the ’70s, and they’ve always shared with everybody that dulse is a great substitute for bacon if you’re vegetarian.” But the story is a good metaphor for what’s going on in the world of seaweed right now. Consumers are discovering a local food source that has been around for millennia, but has rarely been used in American cooking and is little known except when ordered in a dish at a Japanese restaurant. Now Americans and western Europeans are beginning to embrace it, and at the same time realizing here in Maine that we’ve got our own handy local supply right on the coast. As Americans have eagerly taken to foraging and growing their own food, and become more open to experimentation in the kitchen, they’ve developed a taste for seaweed. Statistics, even national ones, are hard to come by, but Baum + Whiteman, an international food and restaurant consulting firm in New York, recently took note of seaweed’s newfound popularity in the American diet. Seaweed “may not be the next kale but it’s on the upslope of the trendline,” the firm wrote in its predictions for 2015. Inspired by ocean-to-table philosophies and the new interest in Nordic cuisine, chefs are adding seaweed to broths, sauces and risottos “for its punch of umami and evanescent background flavor and dash of salinity.” In Maine, enthusiasm for seaweed overflowed at the first Maine Seaweed Festival last year. Organizers went into the event with their fingers crossed for a decent turnout, but 1,500 people showed up to learn more about and sample different varieties of seaweed. It was, Redmond said, “a remembering of what we have right here in our own backyards.” Adding to the increased demand for local seaweed are concerns about sea vegetables sourced in the Pacific Ocean, including worries about radioactivity from the Fukushima nuclear plant in Japan, Redmond said. “We say sea vegetable when we refer to the seaweeds that people usually eat for food,” she said. “You can eat any of the seaweeds, but there’s certain ones we tend to use more in cooking, and those are sugar kelp, horsetail kelp and winged kelp.” At this year’s Maine Seaweed Festival on Aug. 29, there will be plenty of opportunities to learn how to cook with those varieties, as well as taste them in forms that go beyond sushi or a bowl of noodles. “There’s not much good publicity about seaweed,” said Rod Williams of VitaminSea in Biddeford Pool. “Everyone thinks ‘Oh it’s that yucky stuff on the beach.’ What we have tried to do is promote the nutritional value, and if you prepare it the way people do in Ireland and Europe and Asia, there’s a yum factor.” Hillary Krapf, one of the organizers of the festival, says people are looking for easy, accessible and versatile ways to get more nutrients into their diet. Seaweed is now showing up in baked goods, smoothies and salads. It can be a great source of iodine, protein, vitamins and minerals, she said. “When you read the benefits of seaweed, you can’t help but try it,” Krapf said. “My catchphrase is, it’s the Total of the sea.” Maine does have a tradition of cooking with seaweed stretching back to native Americans and the classic New England clambake. Redmond has spoken with old-timers who told her when Mainers went fishing offshore, they’d stay on the islands and use seaweed to thicken their chowders and stews. “It contains these complex polysaccharides in cell walls,” she said. “When you boil or simmer it, it comes out in the liquid and makes it really nice and thick and creamy.” There is also an old tradition of putting dried kelp in beans to help make them more digestible. The kelp, Redmond said, “also has natural amino acids that impart umami flavor to foods.” Seaweed helps hold moisture and adds saltiness to meat and sausages, Redmond said. Its natural anti-microbial properties help to improve the shelf life of breads. As Mainers of all stripes have come to appreciate the flavor and nutritional value of seaweeds, they’ve become more creative in cooking with them. The menu at this year’s festival sounds like something Disney cartoonists might have created for Ariel and the rest of “The Little Mermaid” gang. Lear’s Old Fashioned Ice Cream will be serving seaweed ice cream in flavors like ginger citrus kelp and chocolate sea salt dulse. For a savory-but-still-naughty option, The Fishin’ Ships food truck will be making seaweed French fries. Other choices will include seaweed popcorn, seaweed burritos, and dulse cheese from Silvery Moon Creamery. Skip your usual cinnamon raisin bagel with cream cheese that morning and save room for a seaweed bagel from Southside Bakery in South Portland. The festival commissioned the bakery to make the bagels last year, and they proved so popular, they ended up on the menu at One Fifty Ate, the cafe on Pickett Street owned by the same couple, according to co-owner Kate Schier-Potocki. The bagels, which are made with dulse, sell well, she said, particularly when paired with salmon. “It’s the only bagel where we actually infuse the ingredient into the dough as opposed to just having it be a topping,” she said. “The flavor really came through a lot stronger that way.” Schier-Potocki said Southside Bakery also adds a mixture of pulverized, purplish Maine dulse and Maine sea salt to, say, a salad of greens and carrots for extra color. To wash it all down at the festival, David Carlson of Marshall Wharf Brewing Co. will be pouring Sea Belt, his new seaweed beer made with dried Maine sugar kelp and MacFindlay Scotch Ale. The brew, released for the first time last year, will also be available on tap at certain Portland bars around the time of the Seaweed Festival. Carlson said the beer is made by adding 6 pounds of dried seaweed – the equivalent of 60 pounds of wet, fresh seaweed – to a 200-gallon batch of ale. Most beers that claim to be seaweed beers – there aren’t many – use seaweed to heat or smoke the malt during the malting process, Carlson said, rather than putting it directly into the beer. “It was really important to us to put the seaweed in the beer and not just use it as a gimmick,” he said. But suppose you don’t want to make seaweed beer, ice cream or fries' Two chefs at the festival will advise home cooks how to incorporate seaweed into their repertoire. Given the many varieties, it can be intimidating, acknowledges chef David Ross, who has a seaweed salad on his menu daily at 50 Local in Kennebunk. He previewed the seaweed primer he’ll be doing at the festival: Dulse flakes are good in bread and pizza dough; wakame in salads; and kombu in soups and broths. And he offered a simple shorthand recipe: Sprinkle a white fish fillet with sea salt and lemon and a parsley or rosemary gremolata. Wrap in wakame. Steam for 4 to 5 minutes. Ross also plans to talk about how to get kids to eat seaweed by adding it to dishes like mac-and-cheese. A father himself, Ross said he’s always searching for ways to get more nutrition into his child’s diet. The Maine Seaweed Festival won’t be the end of it, Krapf said. Festival organizers are working on a new venture that would provide information and education about seaweed at events held year-round. It’s called Moon and Tide Seaweed Education & Entertainment.",good,seaweed aquaculture,2015,Maine
81,10057,Maine isn’t doing enough to protect Gulf from effects of climate change - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram,"Some say the state needs more funding to collect data, monitor waterways and assess the impact of acidification.  W hen the Maine Legislature’s commission on ocean acidification reported its findings – that the state’s fisheries and aquaculture industries were threatened by this baleful byproduct of global warming – officials here were not exactly spurred to action. Acidification, driven by increased carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and freshwater runoff from extreme rainfall in river basins, has been implicated in failures at oyster hatcheries and mussel farms, and has been shown to weaken clams and other shell-building animals vital to Maine’s fishing and aquaculture industries. But bills introduced in the last session – one each by a Democratic marine scientist and a Republican lobsterman – to implement many of the panel’s findings were withdrawn, one for lack of resources, the other for lack of support from Gov. Paul LePage’s administration. “I could see the bill wasn’t going to go anywhere and that the governor was going to veto it,” Rep. Mick Devin, a Democrat from Newcastle, says of legislation he sponsored to allow the commission to continue its work for another three years. Patricia Aho, who was the commissioner of environmental protection until she resigned in August, opposed Devin’s bill, saying the status quo was sufficient. “Since the issues of climate change and ocean acidification are inextricably linked, we think it will be more efficient to consider this issue in the broader context of climate change and adaptation programs,” she said in written testimony to legislators. Devin’s bill and another one sponsored by Rep. Wayne Parry, a Republican from Arundel, were carried over to the next legislative session. Parry’s bill would have put a bond issue on the ballot that would borrow $3 million to fund several of the expert committee’s recommendations: collecting data, monitoring waterways, and performing tests in coastal waters to better assess the impact of acidification on wildlife and commercial fish species. It was withdrawn after failing to make it to the top of an informal list of bonding priorities drawn up by legislative leaders.  T he Gulf of Maine has been warming at a rate faster than nearly anywhere else on the planet, and water temperatures in 2012 were the highest in the century and a half that readings have been collected. The impacts, including the retreat of native species, the spread of invaders from more southern climes, and the acidification of seawater, have been substantial and are expected to be more so in the future, as long-term warming trends make 2012-like temperatures the “new normal” by mid-century. Experts say there’s little that Maine or New England can do by itself to address the underlying issue: the continued warming of the Earth because of greenhouse gas emissions from factories, cars, power plants, livestock feedlots and other human activities. Maine produces just 0.32 percent of the nation’s greenhouse gas emissions, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which works out to about .05 percent of those in the world. But Mainers could mitigate the damage by shoring up the Gulf of Maine ecosystem, reducing other stresses we can control and learning ways to protect resources from some of the worst effects. “We have to pay attention to the factors we can exert some control over and try to identify ones that would produce the best possible return, the best bang for your buck,” says Katherine Mills, a fisheries ecologist at the Gulf of Maine Research Institute in Portland, who has studied the effect of warming sea temperatures on salmon and other species. “If we limit pollution, if we reduce excess nutrients in our rivers, if we ensure the coastal habitats to be as robust as they can be, that’s going to help the system to be resilient,” says Matt Abbott, the Fundy Baykeeper at the Conservation Council of New Brunswick, an environmental group. “Even if we don’t know exactly what is going to happen, we know changes are occurring and that the system needs to be as robust as it can.” At a local level, scientists believe there are ways to mitigate the effects of one aspect of a warming gulf, ocean acidification. Eelgrasses and kelps take up dissolved carbon dioxide at a remarkable rate – with almost triple the effectiveness of a similar acreage of forest – and consumes excess nutrients, the two primary drivers of acidification. In doing so, they reduce the acidity of the surrounding seawater, to the benefit of clams, mussels and other creatures living nearby. The Rockland-based Island Institute, a nonprofit that supports coastal communities, is partnering with a commercial kelp farm off Chebeague Island and scientists at the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences in East Boothbay to find out how effective and widespread these benefits can be. This winter – the growing season for kelp – they’ll deploy monitoring equipment around one of Ocean Approved Inc.’s first-in-the-nation open-ocean commercial kelp farms. (Disclosure: this reporter is a Bigelow trustee.) “You may very well be able to improve the growing conditions for shellfish on a very local level by locating a kelp farm with shellfish,” says Suzie Arnold, the marine scientist at the Island Institute who is collaborating on the effort. Kelp, she says, could become “the new kale,” a nutritious food source, while improving the environment, the survival of shellfish, and the winter employment opportunities in fishing communities. Eighty-seven percent of the value of Maine’s $585 million commercial fish catch comes from shell-building creatures, including lobsters, clams, scallops and oysters. The federal government estimates the industry supports 33,000 jobs in Maine, roughly half of them ashore.  T hose on the front lines of acidification are frustrated that the state government isn’t doing more. “Maine’s resource industries are what defines the state, and it totals up to a lot of money,” says Bill Mook, founder of Mook Sea Farms, who watched acidic water devastate crops of newly hatched oysters. “It boggles my mind that as a state we wouldn’t act on bills that would give us some idea of what businesspeople like me will be facing.” The ocean acidification commission, a panel of scientists, fishermen, aquaculturists and legislators that studied the problem, issued a range of recommendations, many of them focused on the collection of data that will help assess more precisely what the impacts are and will be on key species. The “most alarming” finding, their 122-report stated, was “how much we do not know about ocean acidification and how it will affect Maine’s commercially important species.” “We’re far more dependent than at any other time on lobsters, for instance, but we don’t know what the pH is in the important coastal regions where the juvenile stages of development and settlement of lobsters occur and how it affects their survival,” says state Sen. Chris Johnson, D-Somerville, who co-chaired the commission with Rep. Devin. “We can’t wait until we have a collapse of an economically important species for our industry. We need to be working now on how to test mitigation strategies and build our monitoring.” Parry, the lobsterman legislator who sponsored the acidification monitoring bond, agrees. “The biggest thing we learned on the commission was that we don’t have enough data,” he says. “I’m normally not a bond person, but we need to be able to get the equipment so that we can have continuous, real time monitoring so we can determine what is what. It’s very important for the survival of all Maine fisheries.” The DEP, asked to substantiate why it believes existing programs are sufficient to deal with the problem, sent the Press Herald a five-page summary of its programs that touch on climate change, including providing technical assistance for eelgrass restoration in Casco Bay, the routine collection of discharge data from polluters, participation in the acidification commission’s meetings and the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a multi-state effort to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Asked to comment on the DEP summary, Sen. Johnson said “it’s suggesting that what we’re doing already is good enough. That is not the case.” The administration, he said, left a number of key goals unaddressed, including identifying and reducing acidification-causing nutrient pollution from unpermitted sources, stepping up ocean chemistry monitoring, or creating a body that can coordinate the necessary work. “None of the departments have stepped up to embrace the need for an entity that will move things forward so we don’t just wait for something to happen,” he says. Mick Devin, a marine lab manager and Democratic legislator from Newcastle, says such an entity is vital. “Without a formal committee, none of this is going to be a priority,” he says. “Our state government needs to take the lead on this, because we’re not going to have a federal response on this at this time.”  T he state of Washington has taken the lead in confronting ocean acidification, which threatens its $270 million shellfish industry. Its blue-ribbon panel released findings in November 2012, which helped inform the Maine commission’s study. The day it released the report, Gov. Chris Gregoire ordered state agencies to take steps to implement it and called for increased investments in scientific research and efforts to curb nutrient runoff from land. California convened its own ocean acidification panel in 2012, which has since been joined by the governments of Oregon, Washington and the Canadian province of British Columbia and is now a vehicle to study the issue and build political momentum up and down the West Coast to address the issue. Maine DEP spokesman David Madore said the administration has also made steps to address other aspects of climate change, highlighting the work of the Environmental and Energy Resources Working Group, an interagency panel convened by LePage and chaired by Aho. That group issued a report in September 2014 recommending its work should be continued to coordinate action and the implementation of 31 other specific recommendations, four of which appear to bear directly on climate change effects on the gulf. More than a year later, however, the group has not reconvened. Madore said Aho “had a timetable to restart and expand the Working Group” beginning this fall or winter, but that those plans had been put on hold after her departure last month. Acting commissioner Avery Day is “aware of the importance of this work going forward” but “has not formalized any schedule for implementation.” Two of the four actions directly related to the gulf – the development of a $26.9 million bond issue to repair, replace and upgrade failed septic systems and commercial discharge practices and the creation of new water runoff models for the state – will be acted on once the group reconvenes, Madore said. A third – increasing stormwater assumptions in culvert replacement rules – was implemented this August, he said, backed by $800,000 in grants to help pay for new projects. The other directly relevant recommendation – to assist fishermen in adapting to climate-induced changes in fish stocks – falls under the Department of Marine Resources’ jurisdiction. In a written response for information on how this was being implemented, a department spokesman cited the department’s efforts to develop regulations for the fishing of black sea bass, its support for confronting the green crab explosion (including the fencing of clam flats and the convening of a summit on the issue), and the ongoing development of a long-term lobster fishery management plan. The spokesman also said the department “remains committed to participating in ongoing discussions and supporting efforts by organizations that are targeting” ocean acidification. U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, a Democrat representing Maine’s 1st District, has introduced federal legislation directing the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to assess the likely impacts of acidification on individual coastal communities and identify gaps in knowledge. Her staff said the bill’s short-term prospects were dim because the Republican leadership of the U.S. House had little enthusiasm for funding climate-related research. “I’m really quite concerned about ocean acidification and its impact on the Gulf of Maine,” Pingree said in a statement. “We need more information, more research and we need to be much better prepared.” Parry, the Republican state representative from Arundel, put it this way in his testimony: “We can say it’s mostly from airborne CO2, but we here in Maine are not going to stop China and India from polluting.” “If there are things we can do here in Maine,” he told legislators, “we should try.”",bad,seaweed aquaculture,2015,Maine
82,10063,"With more varieties and growing demand, seaweed is Maine's crop to watch - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram","'Eat your sea greens,' moms may begin telling their kids as kelp and other seaweeds take their place next to potatoes and blueberries among the state's iconic foods. CLARK COVE, WALPOLE — One farmer wore waders, the other was holding hundreds of 5-week-old seedlings in one hand. Their “tractor” was afloat. It was November and planting season at Maine Fresh Sea Farms was in full swing, in spite of a dungeon of fog that made the farm, a football-field-sized area of the Damariscotta River estuary, hard to see. Seth Barker drove the boat while Sarah Redmond did the planting, which in the case of seaweed farming looks akin to casting on in knitting. That is, if instead of needles one used a thick hank of marine rope strung horizontally between moorings and substituted a 200-foot-long spool of twine covered with tiny bits of seaweed for a skein of yarn. As Barker chugged slowly through the water, Redmond played the twine out, twisting it around the marine rope. Planting was over in less than 10 minutes, and the new crop, alaria escultenta, or “winged kelp,” was ready to flourish in the cold water. Next to it were ropes of sugar kelp and dulse in various stages of development. The methods are not brand new, but three things made this crop of special interest. The seedlings had been certified organic by MOFGA, the Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association. They were of an edible variety still in the experimental stages of cultivation. Maine Fresh Sea Farms, which is funded by grants from NOAA (the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) and the USDA, is trying to extend growing seasons to harvest crops year-round, or at least nine months of the year. Winged kelp, like most seaweeds, is a winter crop, gathering nutrients from cool ocean waters when the micro algae of spring and summer have cleared out and the light can reach them. As every ambitious farmer knows, being able to deliver crops consistently throughout the year is a key component of building a business, and Maine Fresh Sea Farms wants to sell not just the more traditionally packaged dry seaweed, but fresh. Redmond, who collaborates with Maine Fresh Sea Farms but works as an extension agent with Maine Sea Grant, began dreaming of being a seaweed farmer at age 15, shortly after the Maine Seaweed Council was formed. Now based at the University of Maine’s Center for Cooperative Aquaculture Research, Redmond is well aware that there are big questions about how well seaweed can be mainstreamed. (Just last month, The New Yorker published an article about seaweed cultivation headlined “A New Leaf,” with the subhead “Seaweed could be a miracle food – if we can figure out how to make it taste good.”) Still, Redmond is seriously optimistic. She leaned backed on the gunwale and began listing off the crops Maine is famous for, potatoes and blueberries being the most obvious. Then she made a promise. “We’re going to be known for kelp pretty soon,” she said. FROM THE DEEP Mainers have been harvesting both red and brown seaweeds – the latter the kind that tend to make small children squeamish about going in the water – for more than a century. Ten Maine seaweeds are harvested or cultivated commercially. All are edible and nutritious, although some more than others have been favored as food. These seaweeds, or “sea greens” as the branding experts would them known, have been used for everything from fertilizing gardens to animal feed to perhaps most consistently, in a financial sense, as a thickening agent for foods like puddings and ice creams. Irish moss, a red algae that yields carrageenan when processed, was driving the economy in Rockland back in the post-World War II years. (It remains an important part of Rockland’s economy, but the company that processes it uses imported seaweeds now.) That’s the wild stuff. Seaweed has also been successfully cultivated, or farmed, worldwide for years; in 2013, after years of research, the Portland-based company Ocean Approved released a manual on how to grow kelp from spores. Redmond helped develop that manual, which is oriented toward New England waters. Maine Fresh Sea Farms uses that manual, but they’re already going beyond it. Those alaria seedlings Barker and Redmond planted were organically produced in the nursery – Redmond grew them naturally in filtered sea water in a tank at her lab in Franklin, but without feeding them the typical synthetic nutrients. (Barker uses fertilizers like fish emulsions for what he has been growing at the Darling Marine Center and because Maine Fresh Sea Farms is not certified organic yet, the final crop won’t be organic.) Kate Newkirk, the assistant director for processing and handling for MOFGA’s organic certification process, laughs when she’s asked if it was a challenge to determine how to determine what organic seaweed farming constitutes. She had to get up to speed on a whole new kind of farm. “Oh yeah,” she said. “It took a lot.” Ultimately, the criteria focus on the ecosystem. An organic seaweed farmer shouldn’t disrupt natural beds or overtax the ecosystem, Newkirk said. Nor can they farm near fish farms because antibiotics are often fed to those fish. Any processing must be contaminant free. But perhaps the most important component of organic certification is what farmers do to protect the natural resource. There’s a frontier feeling to this whole enterprise. Seaweed management is itself new; Maine’s Department of Marine Resources is in the process of developing its first plan, focused on management of rockweed, which is not generally eaten but represents more than 95 percent of seaweed landings in Maine. Simply put, no one wants to deplete seaweeds. These plants protect shorelines, house and feed wild species and are being shown to improve human health. They can even perform what Peter Arnold, one of the founders of Maine Fresh Sea Farms, calls “environmental services.” In one study, seaweed planted right outside a sewage outfall not only thrived, but tested fit for animal feed. “The indication is the plants don’t pick up the nasty stuff,” Arnold said. “They pick up the nutrients.” ON THE ROAD When Arnold called to talk, he was on his way to snowbird it in New Mexico. While his seaweed crop grows in Clark Cove, he’ll be working to expand the market for consumers. He had a 10-pound bag full of kelp (“like the biggest garbage bag you can imagine”) in the back of the car and planned to cut it into “noodles” and other shapes that might work for the home cook. Arnold’s first job was harvesting Irish moss on the Maine coast in 1964. Later he went into the Peace Corps and landed in Chile, where he worked in marine algae development. After he retired from Chewonki, where he was the sustainability director, he and Barker and their third partner, Peter Fischer, who holds their acquaculture lease and started what is now the Pemaquid Mussel Farm, started talking about seaweed as a business. The two NOAA grants Maine Fresh Sea Farms have won include Small Business Innovation Research grants to explore markets for locally grown seaweed. “They (NOAA) are thinking about, ‘How do you feed the world''” Arnold said. “The land is pretty tapped out.” “NOAA has chosen us to be at the vanguard of sea vegetables,” he said. “It is both a real honor and also very serious, because it is so important. Ocean farming is going to be a really big deal.” The grants they’ve received have given Maine Fresh Sea Farms time to test markets. They’re considering ways to freeze and dry their product and sell it wholesale, like a mid-sized farmer. Demand is growing along with awareness – the Maine Seaweed Festival is already planning its third annual event in South Portland – but it’s not exactly a mainstay. It’s Arnold’s task to figure out whether consumers will care about the organic component. And to persuade Maine restaurants and food producers to think of seaweed the way they think of land-based greens. Or spices and salt. Not that long ago, he showed up at Head Tide, a seasonal bakery in Damariscotta, pouches of seaweed in hand. He presented them to baker Anna Jansen and asked her if she could experiment. She tried adding the chopped-up dried kelp to her sourdough. “I really hit it big when I started making rolls,” Jansen said. “You get a depth of flavor. It’s richer.” Chef Andrew Taylor of Hugo’s and Eventide in Portland uses dried sugar kelp as the base for stocks and chowders at both restaurants. He’s looking forward to playing with the fresh seaweeds when the harvest comes in, maybe pickling some of it. “We’ll probably make purees out of the dulse,” he said. He thinks his customers are plenty ready for it. “People have gotten used to it over the last decade or,” he said. But he needs consistency. “They don’t really have much product right now,” he said. If Maine Fresh Sea Farms’ plan to increase their harvest from 2,000 pounds to 20,000 this year succeeds, Taylor should get that. He’ll also get more variety, including some even the most innovative chef might not have heard of. Like “skinny kelp,” a longer and thinner form of sugar kelp. Redmond will seed it this month. “It tastes different,” she said. “But it is really good. Very mild, good consistency.” (As you might guess, she does not hold with The New Yorker’s opinion of seaweed as food.) It should be ready to harvest in May, and like so many local foods, has a level of intrigue that should prove useful in marketing; its parent plants can only be found on ledges in Harpswell. FOSTERING GROWTH “Welcome to the nursery,” Barker says, opening the door onto a room at the Darling Marine Center’s Aquaculture Business Incubator in Walpole. Light streams through the walls of windows and into a few mid-sized tanks in the middle of the room. Sitting in each are pieces of PVC pipe wrapped with twine and tiny seedlings, the same kind of arrangement Redmond had used out in the fields. Maine Fresh Sea Farms set up the nursery in July and by September had their first five-week old kelp seedlings ready to plant. A second crop was in the water by October. The third round of seedlings were already in good shape to plant although to the uneducated eye, they looked mostly like an amber fuzz on the twine. Maine Fresh Sea Farms will turn two in January, but they’d tested the waters for a few years before that. There have been some wins and some misses. Redmond successfully grew laminaria digitata (horsetail kelp) in a tank, but it didn’t take well at the Clark Cove location. Arnold theorizes that it needed faster currents to thrive. Since horsetail kelp is in high demand, Maine Fresh Sea Farms will seek out other places to plant it. Barker is a longtime marine biologist who worked for the Department of Marine Resources for 29 years. Like Arnold, he’s come full circle. His very first job in Maine was in the 1970s at Darling, where he did environmental research on Maine Yankee’s impacts. In the 1980s he grew rope-cultured mussels with Ed Meyers, Maine’s original mussel farmer, in Clark Cove. Unlike Redmond, Barker is not a big consumer of seaweed, a fact he shares predicated by a bashful, “I’ll be honest…” He’s more of a beginner, sprinkling dried dulse (a red algae said to have a bacon like flavor) on popcorn or pizza. But he sees the potential, especially now that he has access to fresh farm-raised product. “You can take a taco and shred some seaweed on it.” Like cabbage. Like radishes. Or anything else at the farmers market. This farm has bigger dreams for aquaculture in the middle – not too big and commercial, not too small to make money, but Barker would still like to pass one traditional signpost of a farmer’s worth. “When we can go to a farmers market and see sea kelp for sale, then we’ll know we are there,” he said.",good,seaweed aquaculture,2015,Maine
83,10088,Rift over sustainability leads to cancellation of Maine Seaweed Festival - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram,"Organizers say a 'Gold Rush mentality' as the product gains popularity threatens the industry's future, but harvesters disagree. The Maine Seaweed Festival is a dream day for New England’s natural food lovers, who spend the day munching on seaweed granola and schmoozing with kelp harvesters at a daylong party astride sun-splashed Casco Bay. But this year, it’s not happening, and a rift between the event’s organizers and some seaweed harvesters is the reason why. The planners of the popular festival, located in the country’s biggest seaweed state, said they are canceling the event this year over concerns about lack of sustainability. Organizer Hillary Krapf, who runs a seaweed products and education company called Moon And Tide, said Maine’s seaweed industry has been besieged by a “Gold Rush mentality” that threatens sustainability as seaweed grows in popularity. New players are getting involved in Maine seaweed farming before there is anywhere near the infrastructure needed to sustainably process and sell it, she said. “I would like to see more regulation and accountability. We can feel good about what we are promoting and make sure we are doing right by the ocean and its resources,” she said. Maine overtook California as the country’s largest producer of seaweed about a decade ago. The Maine Seaweed Festival, held in South Portland, has sprung up along with the growth as an annual chance for the state’s seaweed producers to show off products and celebrate all things related to sea vegetables. The seaweed festival started in 2014 and doubled in attendance to about 3,000 last year. The rise in attendance coincides with growth in Maine’s seaweed industry, which quadrupled its harvest from 2004 to 2014. Krapf declined to single out companies in the seaweed industry that she believes are threatening the sustainability of the crop, which is used to make snacks, soap, dog food, nutritional supplements and many other products. The number of wild-seaweed harvesters in the state has held steady at around 150 to 170 for the last few years, and there are a handful of aquaculture seaweed farmers. Paul Dobbins, who heads a Portland seaweed products company called Ocean Approved, said there are about 20 applications in the pipeline to open new seaweed farms. His company uses about half wild and half farmed, and it plans to move to 100 percent farmed. Dobbins disagreed that Maine’s seaweed industry has a sustainability problem, but added that a lot of new faces are getting into the business. “We see the market expanding dramatically for domestic seaweed,” Dobbins said. “Almost all seaweed in the U.S. is imported, and consumers are looking for a product from waters they can trust.” But Shep Erhart, president of the Maine Seaweed Council and founder of Maine Coast Sea Vegetables, doesn’t paint so rosy of a picture. He said the state is experiencing a “seaweed bandwagon,” and this is a good time for the festival to take a year off. “We can’t meet demand without overdoing it,” Erhart said. “We want to make sure we can meet this demand that Mother Nature is supplying us. We need to step back and slow down a bit.”",bad,seaweed aquaculture,2016,Maine
84,10094,Lisa Moore is diving into seaweed farming - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram,"She's been harvesting seaweed from Casco Bay for four years, and is now pursuing a lease to grow sugar kelp.  For four seasons, Lisa Moore and her boyfriend, Donnie Freeman, have been harvesting the wild seaweed called digitata in the waters of Casco Bay in the months when they aren’t lobstering or scallop diving. But now she’s going into seaweed farming, with plans to sell to Ocean Approved once she gets a lease. The company, which literally wrote the book – OK, manual – on how to grow seaweed, recently raised $500,000 to expand its processing capacity, thus opening the door for purchasing agreements with more farmers like Moore. We talked to Moore about some of the other jobs she’s had (hairdresser!), eating seaweed and why aquaculture feels like the future to her. IN THE PIPELINE: Moore called from the wharf at Bailey Island’s Mackerel Cove, where Freeman keeps his boat, and explained that she’s a farmer without land, so to speak. She’s still working on getting a lease from the Maine Department of Marine Resources to grow sugar kelp. “It is like an eight-month process,” she said. “There is a pre-application to the application and then you have meetings. I have to scout my area, and you have to make sure it is the right depth.” Which would be' About 18 feet. Paul Dobbins, one of the founders and owners of Ocean Approved, is helping her. “Without Paul I’d be like ‘What am doing'’ ” Moore said. HORSEPOWER: Meanwhile, she bought herself a boat, a 39-footer without an engine. She’s working on the engine she plans to put in it. Motors aren’t new to her. “I love mechanics as a hobby,” she said. “I work on my own truck. I used to race cars. I used to race at the Wiscasset Speedway. I land in very interesting places.” NOT HER FIRST SEAWEED RODEO: She’s also practiced by putting in hours working on Ocean Approved’s farm off Chebeague. She even tried processing. “The kelp wraps, for sushi. It’s hard. You can’t break them.” A door started to open, mentally, where she could visualize making a business for herself out of this. “I realized, after so many years, I am never going to be a lobsterman,” she said. She’s Freeman’s sternman, but the wait time for a license is too long – it took Freeman 10 years to get his. “All your fisheries are just closed off,” she said – except for seaweed. “I knew they were trying to get more people into aquaculture, and I thought this would be very cool for me.” HAIR CARE: Her mother grew up in West Point in a family of lobstermen. Her father’s father was from North Bath and had a farm. “My grandfather farmed his own food, from his meat to his vegetables to apples. I say I am combining both of my family heritages.” Other jobs she’s had' Hairdresser. “I had my own shop, LJ’s Hair Shop. I opened it up because I am raising my son alone and I said, ‘I need a day job where I can have him.’ I am a girl that loves a project. After going to hair school and taking that on, I made sure I was there every day. Some girls take a day off, but I was there every day.” MEET CUTE: How does one get from cutting hair to pulling traps and shucking scallops' She knew Freeman through friends and saw him when he worked the door at a favorite bar. One day he called her up and asked if she had any available appointments. He had “gorgeous long hair,” and she wasn’t sure what to do to improve it. “I said, what about a sun highlight, like when the sun bleaches out your hair'” He was pleased enough with the results to offer her a tip and a dinner invitation. “The rest is history. We make a good pair.” She started going out on the water with him regularly and a year ago took on the job of selling his scallops. She gave up her hair salon and hasn’t looked back. “People wonder, when I go lobstering, they say, ‘Isn’t that hard on your back'’ But it’s not as hard as standing all day, and going out on the water gives you such a mental peace.” LIFE LESSONS: When they harvest the wild kelp, digitata, together, Freeman dives for it, fills up the bags and sends them up to her. She shakes off snails and does a quality check before packing it in coolers. “I am the inspector of the kelp. I look at every plant that goes in.” Her hope is that she’ll be able to teach her 11-year-old son the business when she starts farming. He’s going to the Harpswell Coastal Academy next year, and Moore aims to make a connection between the charter school, which does extensive gardening, and her seaweed farm. “I love the education (aspect) of it.” ON THE MENU: There’s always a story of the fisherman who doesn’t eat his catch, but that’s not Moore. Both the digitata and sugar kelp are now a part of her diet. “We like to dry it up and grind it up and put it on our food, kind of like a spice.” Or as with salt and pepper, something automatic she reaches for. When friends express surprise, she asks them, “Do you take a multivitamin'” Seaweed is her version of a vitamin. Her son is a picky eater, but she’s sneaking it into his food. “You could sneak it in anything with a darker color to it. I put it in chili one day.” Everyone loved it. “Where if I told them, they probably would not have eaten it.” She’s brewing up some ideas for marketing dry kelp on her own. And still slightly surprised by this turn of events. “I never, ever thought of eating seaweed. You know how, if it is not something you grow up with …” But as she’s learned, that doesn’t mean you can’t grow old with it.",good,seaweed aquaculture,2016,Maine
85,10109,Kelp company approved for long-term lease - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram,"The OK means Ocean Approved can continue to expand its processing facility in Saco.  A Casco Bay company that bills itself as the world’s first commercial kelp farm got state approval Friday to convert a temporary seaweed plot off Chebeague Island into a 10-year lease, giving it the financial and regulatory certainty it needs to support the expansion of its Saco processing operation. Ocean Approved first began cultivating kelp at the Chebeague site about four years ago, said President Paul Dobbins. In its best season, it produced about 87,000 pounds of sugar, horsetail and winged kelp. The company also holds another standard lease – which lasts for 10 years, as compared to an experimental lease’s three years, and can be renewed – in the waters off Chebeague. “This won’t change what we’re doing on the site, but gives us the certainty we need to invest in the company because we know we will be able to continue to grow kelp there with no interruption,” said Dobbins. “We have been growing pretty fast. We are just finishing up an expansion of our processing facility in Saco. We need product to support the processing operation.” Ocean Approved started growing kelp in 2009, Dobbins said. It has used temporary leases to explore two other sites, one off Blue Hill and another close to Jewell Island, that it eventually rejected for possible long-term cultivation because the water was too rough for the spring harvest or the kelp itself did not thrive there. Off Chebeague, Dobbins said, the kelp can grow up to 5.5 inches a day on a good early spring day. Ocean Approved does not yet have a retail shop, but instead sells its seaweeds to institutions, like smoothie shops from Texas to New York. During harvest time, the company employs 42 part-time seasonal workers to reap and then process the seaweed, in addition to the four full-timers and one part-timer on the books throughout the year, Dobbins said. Dobbins said Ocean Approved isn’t actively looking for more cultivation sites, but is instead helping others to expand kelp production to help fill supply needs and bolster the state’s burgeoning aquaculture industry. The company has gone so far as to put a kelp growing manual on its website to encourage more seaweed farms. Its investors include Coastal Enterprises Inc., Island Institute and Maine Venture Fund. Earlier this year, aquaculture was chosen as one of three industries that should be targeted for development by FocusMaine, a new group of leading business, academic and political figures formed to tackle the problem of economic stagnation in Maine. This week, Gulf of Maine Research Institute issued a report on the Maine aquaculture industry’s potential for quadruple growth in value through 2030, although that focused on shellfish. Maine landed 15 million pounds of seaweed valued at about $530,000 in 2015, according to state figures. That is about three times as much seaweed as it had landed a decade earlier, which was about when Maine overtook California to became the nation’s top seaweed producer. Farmed kelp represents just a fraction of the market, however, even here in Maine, where numbers are still so small that the state doesn’t even release them. As of March 2014, the most recent data that Maine Department of Marine Resources published, Maine had just three leases for about 7 acres of seaweed crops. A typical seaweed growing season begins in November, when farmers begin seeding a plot. The seaweed grows for 90 to 110 days, with peak growth in March and April before a May harvest. Kelp grows best on a protected, muddy bottom about 30 feet deep with a light current.",good,seaweed aquaculture,2016,Maine
86,10111,Rockweed fishery thriving in Maine - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram,"Producers are successfully marketing value-added products made with Maine's most visible seaweed, but concerns over the ecological consequences of cutting the weed have led to a lawsuit.  Eddie Page found his first summer in his new waterfront home in Cundy’s Harbor noisy. The peace and tranquility he was seeking was interrupted in July by the fishermen in front of his house cutting rockweed. The sound of the mechanical harvester was so loud that Page felt compelled to download an app on his smartphone to measure it. “At times we had two machines on our property, and I got 75 decibels each,” Page said. The retired accountant is a self-professed geek, so he also did some filming of the rockweed harvest. Being new to the area, Page did not understand that this is roughly the equivalent of putting your hand on the hilt of a sword. Things got heated and Page gave Brunswick-based Source Inc., the company that had hired the harvesters, a piece of his mind. “I told them, you do not have permission to come on our property,” Page said. This is where the matter of rockweed in the intertidal zone – a legal issue now making its way through Maine’s judicial system – gets very, very sticky. Does Page have the right to tell harvesters, not just “Get off my (seaweed) lawn,” but “Stop cutting it'” Page believes that rockweed to be his. Like every waterfront property owner in Maine, he does own all the way to his low tide line. Those ledges are his. Based on a rule established in Colonial times – the Massachusetts Bay Colony’s Colonial Ordinance of 1641-1647 to be precise – that gives him the right to say, build a dock in that low tide zone. But he must also give way to the public when it is engaged in the acts of fishing, fowling and navigation. The fish, fowl and navigate law is unique to Maine and Massachusetts, and it’s all business in a way; other states typically also allow the public to recreate below the high tide line. People have been harvesting seaweed for a long time, but the scale is changing. Rockweed landings in Maine have doubled in the last 10 years, to 15 million pounds in 2015. It is highly unlikely that in protein-hungry Colonial times, thought was given to the matter of something as futuristic as rockweed nutritional supplements for both human beings and animals (Source Inc.’s major product) or seafood extracts from cooked down or dehydrated ground-up versions being used as organic fertilizer (some of the other products made by Maine’s small but thriving group of rockweed processors). But it’s 2016. Climate change is changing how, where and what Mainers fish. Corresponding concern over sustainability is also changing how and what we eat and grow. And rockweed, that humble plant known in Latin as Ascophyllum nodosum and by nervous swimmers as the creepy stuff where the ocean boogie man hides, represents the clash of issues like nothing else. It’s always been a handy soil enricher. “People have been dragging seaweed up off the beach as long as there has been people and beaches,” says George Seaver, vice president and general manager of Ocean Organics, a seaweed processor in Waldoboro. But rockweed landings in Maine have doubled in the last 10 years, to 15 million pounds in 2015. It’s not a high cash crop – the price per pound averages to 4 cents – but as a value-added product it has become an industry with real potential, including uses that could reduce the amount of chemical fertilizers on agricultural crops. That’s good, right' Generally speaking, yes. But as the fishery has grown, so have tensions over it, including whether or not it should even be a fishery. MURKY WATERS Last December, Ken and Gary Ross, Pembroke brothers whose family has owned land on Cobscook Bay since the 1900s joined with an association of homeowners on Roque Island archipelago near Jonesport, in a suit against a Canadian harvester called Acadian Seaplants, the biggest rockweed harvester in the state. Their claim is that they own rockweed “affixed to and growing in the intertidal area.” The plantiffs aren’t looking for a cut of the cash; they are worried about the ecological impact of removing the rockweed, according to their attorney, Gordon Smith of Verrill Dana. They’re not exactly outliers either. The Rockweed Coalition, which Gary Ross was at one time a director of, signed on 568 properties in 12 towns to a “no-cut registry” (it now goes by the name Save Our Seaweed). The Ross family has worked closely with Robin Hadlock Seeley, a Shoals Marine Laboratory scientist who co-authored a 2012 overview of the sustainability of the rockweed resource in the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences. Her report concludes that commercial-scale rockweed cutting presents a risk to both the coastal ecosystems and the human communities that depend on them. Meaning the fisheries. But the lawsuit isn’t about the ecology per se. It’s about ownership, and that is a murky question, one that a former Maine attorney general, Steven Rowe, concluded lacks a definitive answer. The state’s courts have been “sympathetically generous” in interpreting what fishing is, Rowe wrote to Department of Marine Resources in 2008, but on the question as to whether seaweed falls within the public trust, it has been “inconsistent.” PILGRIM’S PROGRESS Here’s how the seaweed story has unfolded since the Colonial Ordinance: When Maine became a state in 1820, the Massachusetts law came with it. Fish, fowl and navigate. Simple. But seaweed’s place in the fish, fowl and navigation pantheon has been questioned before. In 1843, a lawsuit over trespassing to take “sea manure” found in the favor of the landowner. So did an 1861 ruling, which said seaweed “does not come within the principles applied to aquatic rights.” Forty years later, in the case of Marshall V. Walker, the court seemed to reverse itself, saying of the flats that people “may dig shell fish in them, may take sea manure from them…” Rhyan Blazek harvests rockweed in the mouth of the New Meadows River in Cundy’s Harbor on Tuesday for Source Inc., a Brunswick company that makes seaweed-based nutritional supplements. Harvesters for Source Inc. rotate through their harvest areas every three years to allow the rockweed to regenerate. The back and forth has created a complicated legal picture, the kind that causes people anxiety about bigger ramifications. Like Greg Tobey, general manager for Source Inc.. He believes that if the suit is successful, everything in the intertidal zone would be off limits, including clamming. “If the riparian land owners gain control of that, there is not many of them going to say ‘Yeah, get what you want,’ ” he added. That lament is common, but unfounded, said Gordon Smith. Clamming, musseling, worming or wrinkling (periwinkles) clearly constitute fishing, the attorney said. “Taking any of those resources from the intertidal zone is within the scope of the public trust doctrine,” Smith said. But not, he said, rockweed. RULES AND REGULATIONS To George Seaver, there’s no question. Rockweed might not be a fish per se, but he can come up with (a semi-tortured) walks-like-a-duck analogy to argue that it should be treated as one. “These plants, growing on the rocks, they’re basically mussels with less personality,” he said. “It’s stuck in place by its holdfast. It gets all its nutrition from the sea.” Maine statute defines fish as both a noun and a verb. Lobster, for instance, are not fish under the definition of the noun. But the verb “fish” is described as “to take or attempt to take any marine organism by any method or means.” “So through the definitions, the taking of plants is included in the activity of fishing,” Jeff Nichols, the Department of Marine Resource’s director of communications, wrote in an email. Additionally, there is a statute that authorizes the commissioner to regulate the harvest of seaweed. (Of the 12 species of seaweeds harvested in Maine, rockweed constitutes about 90 percent of the annual landings.) From Gordon Smith’s perspective, the statute doesn’t end the issue. “All that means is that the Legislature has, for the purposes of DMR regulation, said it considers fishing to include harvesting sea plants.” That regulation is still in its infancy. A proposed management plan for rockweed, which divides the coast into sectors, was introduced in early 2014, and all things being equal, should be moving toward finalization. It includes input from other state agencies, including the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife (which protects wildlife habitat for shorebirds) and the Department of Environmental Protection (rockweed sits in a coastal wetland). The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration weighed in as well, citing the poor recovery of the cod fishery and the importance of the rockweed to the fish in its juvenile stage. But the proposed plan is on hold for two reasons – the staff member who would have taken it through the public hearing and review process left the Department of Marine Resources and hasn’t been replaced and Commissioner Patrick Keliher has said publicly that until the lawsuit is resolved, he plans no further action. “From his perspective, it would not make a lot of sense to invest a lot of additional department time and resources in more complicated management measures at this time,” Nichols wrote in an email, “since we expect that greater clarity on the issue of ownership will be forthcoming.” The department began imposing regulations in 2000 as the interest in harvesting rockweed commercially was growing. Permits are required, but the rules are incredibly simple. The holdfast, or base of the plant, is not to be disturbed. The haircut, as it were, must leave a minimum of 16 inches above the holdfast. In 2014 the Department of Marine Resources estimated somewhere between 44 and 61 people were or had been harvesting rockweed in Maine, more than half of them by hand. Rhyan Blazek lets go of a net bag of rockweed as Greg Tobey uses a gaffer hook to pull it to his boat in the mouth of the New Meadows River in Cundy’s Harbor on Tuesday. The two work for Source Inc, a Brunswick company that makes seaweed-based nutritional supplements. Harvesters, except those in Cobscook Bay, where limits are imposed, could land more rockweed and in more locations than they do now. George Seaver points out that the harvest taken annually is only about 1.5 percent of the state’s rockweed biomass. “It is nowhere near what Mother Nature tears off with every ice scouring or storm every year.” Seaver’s harvesters needn’t travel very far. They use a machete, rather than a mechanical harvester, and wait three years before returning to a harvested area. That’s not onerous because extraction process Ocean Organics uses doesn’t require bulk. “The last thing you are going to do is damage the resource within driving distance of your facility,” Seaver said. “Anybody who is a responsible business person is going to be utterly respectful of the health of the resource.” The beauty of this fishery, he said, is that it’s always “right where you left it last year.” It grows back, Seaver said, And thicker. Research in the Department of Marine Resources proposed management plan confirms this, as do other harvesters. Tobey recalls doing some serious rockweed trimming for his father, who was finding it tough to get his boat into his landing on Little Yarmouth Island because the weed was so thick. “Two months afterward, it doesn’t even look like we touched it. It comes back insanely.” Which is why he and Seaver are frustrated by the accusation that they could be doing ecological damage. Source Inc. does not harvest during spring sporing season, for instance, and Tobey said he understands the rockweed’s significance. “If you’re removing too much of the canopy, yeah,” Tobey said. “Crabs, fish, shellfish, they all definitely use the rockweed as habitat.” But consider what happens when you mow your lawn, Tobey suggests. “You cut it down to four inches and the crickets, ants and bugs, they all scatter. But you come back an hour later and you’re going to find the same crickets, ants and bugs. They are all going to be there.” A PERIWINKLE IN TIME Seaver jokes that Robin Hadlock Seeley is “our staunch-not-supporter.” She probably wouldn’t argue with this. But she would argue with some of the arguments put forward by harvesters. Like the thing about Mother Nature taking more of the resource annually than the fishery does. “All of that is feeding the system,” Seeley said. “It’s not like it’s wasted so humans might as well go get it.” She’s an eighth-generation Mainer who grew up in Freeport and spent much of her childhood on the water. In college she studied marine biology, focusing on an organism nearly as humble as rockweed, the periwinkle. While traveling the state looking for a kind of periwinkle she’d found fossiled in mortar on Appledore Island, she visited Eastport in the early 1980s. “I hopped out of the car and there was the living form” of that fossil. But as the invasive green crab traveled up the coast, the populations of periwinkles she’d been so excited about started to disappear. “It was like little lights going out around Cobscook Bay.” Then, she said, she’d see seaweed harvesters come in and start to “hack away” at the rockweed, taking periwinkles, and other by-catch with them. “Number one, it makes no sense, with everything that is going on in the marine environment, to start hacking away at the habitat,” Seeley said. Number two, her research subjects were already in trouble. “I am studying the last few of these species and now they are disappearing into the bottom of the boats.” Rockweed in East Blue Hill in a photo from September 2015. Tobey said his mechanical harvester hardly brings in any by-catch at all. “Maybe an inch in the bottom of a fish tote.” Seeley’s effort began with the periwinkle but she’s been tenacious about protecting the rockweed resource, rallying allies from a host of environmental and conservation organizations, among them Downeast Coastal Conservancy, Friends of Blue Hill Bay, and Schoodic Institute. Among the groups citing the importance of restricting the harvest on seabird nesting islands was the Audubon Seabird Restoration Program, which cited rockweed’s significance to Atlantic puffins and Arctic terns. She’s also the main contact for the cause. Eddie Page, who started out annoyed by noise, poked around on the Internet and found Seeley. Now he thinks less about noise and more about nature. “It’s a bit like me coming onto your property and sawing a limb off your tree and saying, ‘Oh, it will grow back,’ ” he said. He’ll be rooting for that lawsuit to make its way to the Maine Supreme Court and prove, once and for all (or until the next appeal) who the weed belongs to. In the meantime, next time the harvesters come by, he can try asking them to move on. “We’ll go around the corner,” Greg Tobey said. “In order not to be an idiot, or to be rude, we’ll say, ‘I’m sorry, I will do what I can to be quieter.'” But even as he’s being polite, Tobey will be pondering one of those big-picture questions about Maine and its spectacular coast. “You cannot deny the fact that waterfront homes are not owned by minimum wage earners,” he said. “By and large, most of the waterfront homes are not owned by Maine natives.” And that, he says, creates a gap in understanding that goes beyond mere communication. If the view is the priority, waterfront owners aren’t going to be sympathetic to those who make their living in and around their ocean. And drive the state’s economy. Seeley poses – and answers – a big-picture question of her own. “Why is seaweed being taken now' It is because of the decline of the fisheries higher up on the tropic level.” To her, that seems short-sighted. “The risk of doing the wrong thing is so great,” she said.",good,seaweed aquaculture,2016,Maine
87,10116,Chebeague Island shoreline attracts new grower of seaweed - The Portland Press Herald,"Shearwater Ventures joins another Casco Bay harvester in a market that could expand Maine's marine economy.  The waters off Chebeague Island will be even greener than usual this winter. Shearwater Ventures is moving in, joining another company, Portland-based Ocean Approved, in growing and harvesting seaweed in Casco Bay. Nathan Johnson, who started Shearwater last year, just signed a state lease on nearly 4 acres of seabed. Johnson intends to grow sugar kelp, his foray into the $5 billion worldwide kelp industry. Johnson, whose family has deep roots in the fishing industry in Maine, said he’s especially pleased that kelp farming can be done with little or no disturbance to other fisheries along the Maine coast. “It’s going to be exciting to see the different ways the coastal economy can grow,” said Johnson, who lives on nearby Long Island and also works for Ocean Renewable Power Co. He also is a member of the board of trustees at the Island Institute. Kelp grows readily on the coast of Maine, as anyone who has walked a beach in the state can attest. But only recently has it become recognized as a valuable addition to the state’s marine economy. Aquaculture was identified as one of the state’s three top industries – along with agriculture and biopharmaceuticals – that have the potential to grow and add value to Maine’s economy, according to a report written by McKinsey & Co. and commissioned by the economic development group FocusMaine. Some kelp is wild-harvested, Johnson said, which essentially means it’s raked up from beaches on which the leafy sea plants wash up. But kelp farming is just getting a toehold in the state. Johnson’s $100-an-acre annual lease is one of the first handed out by the state. He said the process for farming kelp is relatively straightforward. A PVC tube is wrapped with up to 200 feet of a kite-size string that has kelp spores on it. Then a thicker line, similar to those used on lobster traps, is run through the tube and attached to the spore-lined kelp string. The two lines become entwined, with the spores “planting” themselves on the thicker line as they are eased into the water. Then the line is anchored on the sea floor and suspended by buoys while the kelp grows over the winter. Johnson said the lines end up about 7 feet below the water surface, so they don’t interfere with boating or lobstermen heading out to tend their traps. Any interference between the kelp farming and the fishing industry is further minimized because kelp is “planted” in the fall and harvested in the spring, he said – the opposite of the spring and summer peak seasons for lobstering. Kelp is a hardy plant, Johnson said. “In the right conditions it can grow up to 5 inches a day,” he said, and the yield is often 10 pounds per foot of line, so 200 feet of line can yield a ton of kelp. This year, Johnson is putting in five 1,000-foot lines. The site can handle 15 lines, so he expects the small plot of seabed can yield a lot of kelp within a few years. Initially, Johnson plans to sell his kelp to Ocean Approved, a local kelp-producing company that provides freshly frozen kelp to customers such as Portland’s Flatbread Co., which uses it in some of its salads. “Kelp is the new kale,” Johnson said. In addition to green salads, some restaurants are looking to turn kelp into a coleslaw type of dish, Johnson said, and it can also be processed into cubes that can be added to smoothies, Other types of kelp can be used for biofuel, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, Johnson said. “The market is kind of a big unknown right now, but it’s an exciting time,” he said. “There are a lot of exciting opportunities.” Johnson said the lease with the state is considered a three-year experiment, but if it works out, he will seek a longer-term deal that will keep him farming under Casco Bay.",good,seaweed aquaculture,2016,Maine
88,10134,Maine Voices: Science is critical to helping us adapt to a changing Gulf of Maine - Portland Press Herald,"Environmental changes driven by fossil fuel emissions put at risk many Maine businesses and jobs.  EAST BOOTHBAY — The Trump administration announced plans March 28 to stop the implementation of the Clean Power Plan, introduced in 2014 as a key part of the United States’ contribution toward global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This is the latest move to disregard or dismantle environmental science, including the proposed elimination of funding for most of the Earth observation and climate monitoring activities in the recently released federal budget outline. These actions emerge from a political conversation that focuses on the immediate costs of environmental regulations and monitoring while neglecting the long-term economic and societal damage of climate change. Benjamin Twining is interim executive director and senior research scientist at Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences in East Boothbay. There is decisive scientific evidence of the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on our planet. Excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is a major contributor to climate change. It also naturally dissolves into the ocean, increasing the water’s acidity and making it harder for shellfish to build their shells. There is already growing recognition – not just by scientists, but also among fishermen and aquaculturists – of the changing ocean conditions in the Gulf of Maine. Environmental changes driven by fossil fuel emissions put at risk many businesses and jobs, such as those in the state’s $533 million lobster industry. Through this rollback of efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions, we return ourselves to a dangerous path. Through the proposed defunding of earth science, we would walk that path blindfolded. At Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences, we study the ocean and how it is changing. This work involves uncovering climate’s influence, deciphering connections between the many parts of the ocean food web and then developing solutions to the challenges we find. We are particularly interested in the algae – many of them microscopic – that support the ocean’s ecosystems and produce half of the oxygen we breathe. Microorganisms like these make the ocean, as well as the rest of the planet, what it is today. Their health is essential to our own. Through our research around the globe, we see the same trends that other scientists do: The ocean is changing, and the Gulf of Maine is changing more rapidly than most areas. Warming waters, changing nutrients, shifting water color – these changes exert substantial influence on the gulf’s ecosystem and drive consequences for the people who depend on its resources. Through the support of NASA and its Earth observing program, which the administration proposes to eliminate, Bigelow Laboratory scientists have already documented concerning changes in the Gulf of Maine. Barney Balch has crossed the gulf countless times during the past 18 years to gather and analyze samples. By combining his measurements with data from undersea gliders and NASA satellites, he investigates how the Gulf of Maine works and how it is being affected by long-term changes in climate. His research revealed an astounding 80 percent drop in the productivity of the microscopic algae that form the base of the marine food web. Long-term monitoring is the only way we know these changes are happening, but the proposed budget would cut funding for these observations just when they are most needed. Understanding these environmental changes is only the first thing science can do to help our society face the challenges ahead. Increasing ocean acidity is a particular concern for the Gulf of Maine, and Bigelow scientists are working to help Maine industries adapt. We’re investigating the impact that rising temperatures and increasing ocean acidity will have on lobster, as well as on Maine’s growing shellfish aquaculture industry. Nichole Price is working with kelp growers, oyster and mussel farmers and other nonprofits around the state to examine the effectiveness of growing seaweed alongside shellfish to help lower the acidity of the surrounding water. Federal science programs, such as NOAA Sea Grant, provide crucial support to these collaborations. The current administration’s budget outline would also remove funding for these activities, taking tools for adaptation out of the hands of industry. Science has long served as a stimulus for economic growth and prosperity. It is why we have cars, vaccines and the ability to predict the weather. Simply put, science works, and climate change is real. It is already creating economic challenges, and science and engineering are uniquely poised to help address them. Now or later, we will pay for climate change, and the cost will only get higher as changes become more widespread. By moving to less harmful ways to generate power and by funding science to give us valuable insights into the changes that are occurring, we can reduce our environmental impact and help our society adapt.",good,seaweed aquaculture,2017,Maine
89,10204,"In a hard year for sustainability, here are some of the bright spots for 2017 - Portland Press Herald","Despite the U.S.'s Paris Accord exit and plenty of negatives for the environment there are reasons to hope.  When it comes to protecting the planet and fighting to turn back the ticking clock on climate change, 2017 has not been pretty. In fact, if we listed everything that happened that will likely harm the environment, you’d get depressed. But around Maine in the course of this year, there were many positive actions and events in the world of sustainability. This is not to downplay the impacts of the United States leaving the Paris Accord, the agreement by pretty much the entire rest of the globe to reduce emissions and fight climate change together.

OUT OF THE WOODS Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, left, and Lucas St. Clair look out over the Katahdin Woods & Waters National Monument in June. The new park survived a federal review of monuments nationwide considered for possible downsizing or expanded logging. Staff photo by Gregory Rec It was a nail biter of a year for the new Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument. In June, the new U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke, charged by the Trump administration with reviewing 27 national monuments designated since 1996, toured the monument. Designated as a national monument in August 2016 by President Barack Obama after years of debate over its future, Katahdin Woods and Waters represents an 87,500-acre gift from the family of Roxanne Quimby, the co-founder of Burt’s Bees. It’s been controversial. Gov. Paul LePage dislikes it intensely; he once dismissed the region the monument is in as Maine’s “mosquito area.” In August, leaks of a draft report suggested that Zinke would support the brand-new monument, but some speculated that he might push for logging beyond forest management. Earlier this month, with the release of Zinke’s final report, that speculation was put to rest: He supports the monument and no logging will be allowed. Meanwhile, people visited, 30,000 of them, despite some serious roadblocks to finding the place. (About 72,000 visited nearby Baxter State Park in 2017). The National Park Service said visitors came to Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument from 45 states and nine countries. While the monument’s fate hung in the balance, LePage blocked the manufacturing and installation of Maine Department of Transportation road signs for it along I-95. Presumably, now that Zinke’s recommendations are finalized, work will start on the signs' Nope. Maine Department of Transportation spokesman Ted Talbot said the governor needs to hear from President Trump himself. “We are on hold,” Talbot said. Apparently only the president gets to determine how many road signs should go up and what they will look like. “Are they going to be very large overhead signs'” Talbot said. “We are waiting for a recommendation.” Okay. Maybe by the time the snow melts or the next governor is elected in less than a year. In the meantime, the National Park Service website can help get you there. COLLINS SPEAKS OUT ON CLIMATE CHANGE One Monday in late October, Sen. Susan Collins stood on the Senate floor to speak about a subject that’s become all but forbidden during the Trump administration. Cutting taxes, Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and overhauling the Affordable Care Act have sucked up most of the air in Congress this year, but the Republican from Maine wanted to remind her colleagues about climate change. Specifically, she spoke on what she called the “astonishing” cost of climate change, outlined in a study by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) on the economic impacts of climate change. Collins and Sen. Maria Cantwell, a Democrat from Washington state, had joined forces in 2014 to request the report, which was released Oct. 23. The economic losses associated with the extreme weather events of climate change were expected to exceed $300 billion in 2017 alone. Climate change is a public health and environmental issue, Collins said, but also a looming financial crisis. For everyone. “From whatever angle you look at this issue, whether it is economic, environmental, our livelihoods or public health, climate change is not discriminating between Democrats or Republicans or Greens or independents,” Collins said in a phone interview last week. “It should be of concern to all of us.” Reflecting on that day, Collins said she was relieved that this latest GAO report was even released, given the tension around the issue. “It confirms the impact of human activity on global warming, and since the EPA adminstrator (Scott Pruitt) – who I voted against confirming – has raised doubts about that, I was pleased that there was no interference.” Why isn’t climate change a bipartisan issue' “At one point when people began focusing on these issues years ago, it was nonpartisan,” Collins said. “There are Republicans who are interested in this issue and recognize the threat that climate change poses to our economy and our way of life. But somewhere, the public debate did change on it, and it has become a more partisan issue.” She hopes colleagues will pay attention to the GAO report. “It should be a call to action,” Collins said. “It clearly says that the federal government is not prepared.” POLLINATORS PLUS ONE The rusty patched bumblebee is now protected. Photo courtesy of The Xerces Society A bee native to Maine, the rusty patched bumblebee (Bombus affinis) was listed as endangered earlier this year by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the very first bumblebee to make that list. It hasn’t been seen in Maine since 2009, but if any if the species are left, they are now protected. Another bumblebee, the yellow banded (Bombus terricola) could be added to the list in 2018. Given how important pollinator-dependent crops are in the state (think blueberries and apples), protecting and encouraging what’s left is essential. That’s why United States Department of Agriculture recently designated $80,000 in funding from its Natural Resources Conservation Service to help landowners and farmers in Maine protect pollinator resources. Anyone can apply for funding to help establish, maintain and protect pollinator habitat. That might mean increasing floral diversity or creating nesting opportunities for bees on farms and woodlots. To learn more, contact a local USDA Service Center; Maine has 14, including offices in Augusta, Belfast, Lewiston and Scarborough. This fall, Maine also got a newly identified wasp species named after the state motto, dirigo (“I lead”). A Brunswick native and former University of Maine student, Hillary Morin Peterson, the subject of this week’s Meet, discovered the new species in Harpswell and named it Ormocerus dirigoius. Wasps are no fun at picnics, but they are nonetheless significant pollinators. Ormocerus dirigoius is a non-stinging wasp, which makes us love it even more. FARMING THE OCEAN Sales of mussels grown in Maine aquaculture operations are strong, and demand outstrips supply. A professor at the University of Maine at Machias has won a grant to study large-scale culture of blue mussel seed, which could help increase production. Staff photo by Shawn Patrick Ouellette Maine’s marine fisheries took some hits this year, with fewer baby lobsters to be found, which raises questions about lobstering’s future, and the shrimp fishery closing for the fifth consecutive year, suggesting that Maine shrimp may just be a thing of the past. But others were busy planting new seeds in those waters. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (N.O.A.A.) allocated a grant of $908,015 for research into sustainable processing of aquacultured seaweed and development of new value-added products. A team from the University of Maine School of Food and Agriculture will take the lead on that project. Another big grant from NOAA went to Brian Beal of the Downeast Institute for Applied Marine Research and Education (he’s also a professor at the University of Maine at Machias). He was awarded $249,238 to study the large-scale culture of blue mussel seed. While Maine’s mussel farms are doing well, they can’t keep up with demand, and according to the University of Maine, the major factor limiting their expansion is seed production. Beal will evaluate the best ways to both collect and culture mussel seed. Aquaculture leasing applications are way up in Maine, according to Jon Lewis, who leads the Maine Department of Marine Resources Aquaculture program. “We are seeing a large uptick in applications,” Lewis said. “Primarily in oysters and seaweed, with much of it in Casco Bay.” But there are also applications for growing scallops on a rope or mussels, he said. The applicants range from coastal land owners who want to experiment with a hobby farm to fishermen trying to diversify. “We’ve got lobstermen looking to supplement income, in case lobstering falls flat,” Lewis said. FROM THE MOUNTAINS TO THE SEA The effort to connect Mount Agamenticus in York to the seashore over contiguous parcels of conserved land progressed in 2017. Staff file photo by Karen Beaudoin The Mount Agamenticus to the Sea Conservative Initiative started in 2002 with a major ambition: connect the mountain to the sea in conservation land. Mount Agamenticus is only 692 feet high, but has views for days, like the kind that inspired the military to put a radar tower atop the summit in 1941, and each year between 40,000 and 60,000 visitors hike to the top. The goal was not just to create a path as the crow flies, but one that stretched south through forests and marshes, along the York River and to the southernmost parts of Maine. Ten organizations, including the Kittery Land Trust, the York Land Trust, The Nature Conservancy and U.S. Fish and Wildlife/Rachel Carson National Wildlife Refuge, banded together to pursue the dream of putting 19,000 acres from the mountain in York to Gerrish Island in Kittery into conservation, weaving through parts of six towns along the way. The groups have been slowly chipping away at that goal for 15 years, and this year, added two important pieces to it. In May, a 90-acre piece of wooded land abutting the York River that had been owned by the family of the late Mary McIntire Davis, an eighth-generation York resident and conservationist, was turned over to the Rachel Carson National Wildlife Refuge. Another piece of the puzzle, the 220-acre Fuller Forest in York, was acquired by the York Land Trust earlier this month. It had belonged to the family of the late Marion Fuller Brown, a member of the Maine House of Representatives and one of the founders of the York Land Trust. Her family sold it to the York Land Trust at a considerably reduced rate. This most recent acquisition creates a contiguous block of 1,300 acres in conservation, backing up to the Rachel Carson National Wildlife Refuge. “It is really a huge part of that puzzle piece, of this mosaic of land in conservation,” said Doreen MacGillis, the executive director of the York Land Trust. Together, these acquisitions put the Mount Agamenticus to the Sea Conservation Initiative within 5,000 acres of its target. MacGillis said the group is projecting it will cross that finish line in 2032. Why is this region of hills and forest next to the sea so important' For one thing, MacGillis said, it is the largest undisturbed coastal forest between Acadia National Park and New Jersey’s Pine Barrens. And it’s varied, “It’s where the northern spruce forest meets the southern hardwood forest,” MacGillis said. As such, this coastal forest provides habitat for rare and threatened species, including the Blanding’s and spotted turtles, and the state’s greatest area of biodiversity (100 species of birds can be found along the York River alone). “The fact that it is still there is quite remarkable,” MacGillis said. GROUND BREAKING This fall, Wolfe’s Neck Farm in Freeport took on a new name, Wolfe’s Neck Center for Agriculture & the Environment, but more important, a new mission, positioning itself as a locus for regenerative agriculture. That’s a new movement with a surprising new twist on fighting climate change, namely treating soils around the globe as carbon sinks to absorb – and trap – the greenhouse gases that are causing climate change. Organic material in soil does this naturally, but by building it up with more organic material and employing methods like no-till farming and extensive use of cover crops, proponents of this movement believe they can slow the march of climate change. What’s Wolfe’s Neck role in all this' The nonprofit is using sensors to measure what’s happening beneath the surface and working with soil gurus to enhance the dirt’s potential. As an observatory for regenerative agriculture, it will experiment with and formulate the kind of dirt-centric recipes that can enhance soil’s power to sequester carbon, and then promote them to other farms and growers. This is a case of an agricultural organization actively pushing for a solution and acknowledging the problems inherent in agriculture. We talk about cars and air conditioners and all the fossil fuel-burning sources of greenhouse gases, but agriculture has played a big role in changing our climate, as well. Experts debate what percentage of greenhouse gases come from farming, but figures range from 7 percent in the United States to 25 percent worldwide by some estimates. Methane releases from livestock – Wolfe’s Neck has cows, goats and sheep – represent 37 percent of agriculture’s contribution, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. NEW HOPE ON NEW ROOTS A group of Somali-Bantu farmers who excelled in the farming training program at Cultivating Community took a major leap forward this year with the establishment of their own farm, New Roots Cooperative Farm in Lewiston. Amran Hassan, 9, of Lewiston walks through a field that will become a working farm. Staff photo by Derek Davis Cultivating Community is Maine’s leader in helping new American farmers, many of whom worked in agriculture in Africa, find pieces of land to farm here in Maine. They work side by side on small plots with other immigrants, sharing an acre or even less, to grow vegetables both for their own use and to sell at farmers markets. It’s been a way to help displaced people get their feet wet farming in Maine, and Cultivating Community has helped train them in Lisbon and the Greater Portland area. This year, a group of four Somali-Bantu farmers who have been through the farming training program at Cultivating Community and excelled at it, took a major leap forward with the establishment of their own farm, New Roots Cooperative Farm in Lewiston. Cooperative is a key word here; the land they are leasing to own was purchased by Maine Farmland Trust. A third group, Cooperative Development Institute, is also providing guidance and mentorship. This spring, these farmers who have found a home in Maine planted vegetables and crops on land that was once part of a family-owned dairy farm. They also installed a well, solar panels, a cooler and a wash station; signed up 120 community supported agriculture customers; and brought produce to six farmers markets, two food pantries and an assisted living facility. Next year, they’ll expand to about 11 acres of land in production. Another positive for 2017' Cultivating Community negotiated to manage and run Falmouth Land Trust’s Hurricane Valley Farm, and plans to dedicate the 62-acre site on Route 100 to sustainable agriculture. Hurricane Valley will be a place for beginning farmers to grow food for their families, raise livestock, cultivate fruit and learn about developing a farm business. MANY MORE MORNINGS IN MAINE You may have visited this place, in your imagination. It’s where Sal lived, where she wiggled her tooth, where she clammed, where she helped her mother put up blueberries for the winter. This year, Outer Scott Island, a 6.2-acre island in Penobscot Bay owned by the family of “Blueberries for Sal” and “One Morning in Maine” writer and illustrator Robert McCloskey, was officially given to the Nature Conservancy in Maine. The donation has been in the works for years; the family gave a conservation easement on the property in 1974. But this year’s action means Outer Scott Island will be part of the conservancy’s network of preserves in Maine. The island is accessible only by boat, and visitors are welcome during the day. There are no services or hiking trails on the island. McCloskey died in 2003, but his daughter Sarah McCloskey said at the announcement of the transfer that he wanted “to make sure that future generations have a chance to enjoy it like our family did.” Now Mainers with boats will get to sit on its shores, in times of quiet wonder and great joy.",good,seaweed aquaculture,2017,Maine
90,10229,South Portland considers pier upgrades in hopes of aquaculture boom - Portland Press Herald,"The long-neglected Portland Street Pier is due for major improvements that could make it a home base for burgeoning mussel- and oyster-farming operations.  SOUTH PORTLAND — It’s not easy to find the Portland Street Pier, but it’s there, right off Front Street, wedged among the Sunset Marina, the Saltwater Grille restaurant and a couple of massive green fuel tanks owned by the Portland Pipe Line Corp. There’s no sign trumpeting its location, even though it’s one of South Portland’s prime waterfront assets. The weathered gray structure at the edge of Portland Harbor is empty and icy quiet this time of year, when the docks have been pulled from the water and the nine lobstermen who use the facility from spring through fall keep their fishing boats elsewhere. City officials are trying to change that. They’re taking steps to improve and expand the long-neglected municipal pier in the hope of turning it into an incubator for aquaculture enterprises in Casco Bay. To prove that they’re heading in the right direction, they point to the ongoing development of about 10 new aquaculture leases in the region, which could double the number of commercial operations growing mussels, oysters, scallops or seaweed in the nutrient-rich waters off Maine’s largest metropolitan center. “It’s the right thing to do at the right time,” said City Councilor Claude Morgan, who lives near the pier. “We think there’s immediate demand for this kind of support for aquaculture in Maine. It’s an opportunity to show you can have a working waterfront, do it sustainably and have it become a force for economic growth in the community.” Morgan is pushing a proposal that would add six to eight berths at the pier in the next year or so in the form of floating docks. It would be a first step toward possibly enlarging and dredging the pier over the next few years so it could withstand destructive winter storms and be accessible at all tides. Both conditions are necessary to support year-round aquaculture and commercial fishing.  Assistant City Manager Josh Reny plans to deliver a basic design and cost estimate for the additional berths to the City Council in the next few weeks. Anything more significant, such as expanding the pier or dredging existing shallow berths, would require a feasibility study, including a professional survey and cost-benefit analysis, and a master plan, if it gets that far. Expanding the pier could cost $500,000 to $2 million, by some estimates. City officials are also talking about joining a local effort to dredge sediment-bound private and municipal piers in Portland and South Portland that could add to the expense. If the larger pier project were approved, the city could tap state grants and other funds earmarked for economic development, Reny said. “It’s not going to be cheap, so we need to understand what the return on investment might be and whether there’s sufficient demand,” Reny said. “There isn’t a facility in the harbor that’s geared toward aquaculture right now, so there’s support for it generally.” AQUACULTURE IS GROWING Aquaculture in Casco Bay is on the verge of significant growth, according to the state Department of Marine Resources, which oversees 110 aquaculture leases covering 1,200 acres along the Maine coast, including Atlantic salmon that’s farmed Down East. There are 11 active aquaculture leases in Casco Bay – nine for shellfish and two for seaweed, said Jon Lewis, director of Maine’s aquaculture program. In addition, there are two pending lease applications and eight or nine lease proposals that are being developed, Lewis said. “There is tremendous opportunity for aquaculture in Maine,” he said. “Having a municipality (such as South Portland) support aquaculture would be huge.” The pending aquaculture operations face significant hurdles, Lewis said, starting with getting state and federal approvals. The lengthy vetting process includes ensuring that the shoreline or floating farms won’t interfere with  navigation routes and other existing uses. Finding adequate and affordable waterfront access is a concern for many aquaculture operations, Lewis said, especially because they need space for their trucks, gear, cold storage and processing activities. But the demand for farm-raised shellfish has clearly increased in recent years as more consumers seek locally grown and sustainably harvested products. “In the last five years, everybody seems to be jumping on it,” he said. Lewis’ assessment is backed by a study released in October by the Gulf of Maine Research Institute. In 2015, Maine aquaculture operations harvested $6.5 million worth of shellfish – about 25 percent of Maine’s $24 million overall shellfish harvest and a fraction of the $700 million in oysters, mussels and scallops harvested in the United States, according to the Maine Farmed Shellfish Market Analysis. Researchers determined that the total economic benefit of Maine shellfish aquaculture that year was as high as $15 million. Researchers also concluded that Maine’s farmed shellfish capacity – about 600 leased acres with another 75 or so in the lease application process at the time of the study – “is not sufficient to meet the projected demand.” Maine needs an additional 550 to 600 acres of shellfish aquaculture by 2030, including 480 new acres of oysters and 90 new acres of mussels cultivated on ropes hanging from rafts. That’s about 35 to 40 additional acres annually through 2030. The research institute report concluded that the industry has the potential to quadruple its value to $30 million by 2030. Separately, a new economic development group called FocusMaine has identified aquaculture as one of three industries where Maine could make investments that would produce dramatic returns for the state’s economy. CLOSE TO MARKET DEMAND Peter Stocks, a South Portland resident who farms blue mussels in Casco Bay, has experienced the growing demand for his product and is eager to see the city provide a platform for others to join him in friendly competition. A former corporate lawyer, Stocks launched the Calendar Island Mussel Co. in 2011, starting with a few rope rafts floating on a couple of acres in the middle of the bay. He expanded his lease holdings to 7 acres last year, hoping to meet the growing market for mussels he ships to Boston, New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. He has six rafts now, with ropes of the shellfish dangling into the deep. He plans to add six rafts this spring and six more next year. “The Maine brand in seafood is very well-recognized and marketable around the world,” Stocks said. “We’re within a 24-hour drive of 100 million people. The potential for aquaculture here is only getting stronger with the growing interest in farm-to-table produce and sustainability.” Stocks said he has four full-time and two part-time employees, and he expects to hire more in the future. He has a long-term lease on space at Deake’s Wharf off Commercial Street in Portland and regularly works out of Handy Boat Marina in Falmouth, but he admits that he’d rather have his base of operations near where he lives. Stocks is a member of the city’s Economic Development Committee, which supports the pier project for a variety of reasons. Most notably, promoting development of underused waterfront property is a goal identified in the city’s Economic Development Plan adopted last year. “The pier is a public asset that is not being used nearly to its capacity,” committee Chairman Ross Little wrote in a recent letter to Mayor Patti Smith and the City Council. “It could be supporting South Portland and regional businesses and generating more revenue for the city,” Little wrote. “Renovation and expansion of the pier, and upgrading (its) building, would support the expansion of aquaculture in our region.” Committee members also agreed that the pier could “generate many times the annual revenue it now collects.” Lobstermen and other tenants pay $1,250 per year for a seasonal berth at the pier, which is substantially cheaper than other Portland Harbor piers that provide year-round access and other services, city officials said. PIER IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED Last year the city collected $20,527 in rental fees for slips and the seasonal building on the pier, and it spent more than $21,000 to fix wooden decking, replace the metal ramp and do other repairs, according to a recent report from Kevin Adams, the city’s director of parks, recreation and waterfront facilities. Twelve of 16 berths were used last year: 11 were leased, one was occupied by the city’s fire boat, two were vacant and two are too shallow to be leased because of sediment. Parks employees install and remove the floating docks each year, with help from firefighters. The seasonal building on the pier is currently unleased and in need of improvements and repairs, as are the pier and the sea wall beneath it, Adams noted. Lobstermen and other commercial fishermen would still be welcomed at the pier, city officials said, but slip fees would likely increase if the city upgraded the facility for year-round use. “It could be good. Depends on what they do,” said Rick Roberts, a lobsterman from Scarborough who has kept his boat at the Portland Street Pier for more than 30 years. Roberts and fellow lobsterman Rick Sullivan said they’ve been spoiled, having the run of the pier for decades. They also said the city has neglected the facility and failed to provide basic maintenance and services to leaseholders. Both wondered how the city would accommodate increased parking and activity on the site. “I’m glad somebody’s trying to do something,” Roberts said.",good,seaweed aquaculture,2018,Maine
91,10271,Gassy cows are bad for the planet; could seaweed diet help? - Portland Press Herald,"Jenni Tilton-Flood, a dairy farmer at Flood Brothers Farm in Clinton, Maine, said she'd be willing to try feeding seaweed to her cows.  The smelly reality is that cows will always pass gas. But if farmers had more access to seaweed, cow flatulence might just stink a little less for the planet. That’s the thesis of a New England-based aquaculture company which is launching a drive to become the worldwide leader in an emerging effort to thwart climate change by feeding seaweed to cows. The concept of reducing livestock emissions by using seaweed as feed is the subject of ongoing scientific research, and early results are promising. University of California researchers have found that cows that eat seaweed appear to emit less methane, a greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming when they belch and pass gas. But one of the big challenges to implementing the seaweed solution is getting enough of the stuff to farmers, and the kind of seaweed that has shown results in cows isn’t commercially farmed. Enter Australis Aquaculture of Greenfield, Massachusetts, which is in the midst of research at facilities in Vietnam and Portugal that is part of its push to become the first farm to produce the seaweed at commercial scale. The company calls the effort “Greener Grazing” and it expects to be operating at commercial scale in two years, said Josh Goldman, the company’s chief executive officer. “If you could feed all the cows this seaweed, it would be the equivalent of taking all these cars off the road,” Goldman said. “Greener Grazing’s mission is to cultivate this, and accelerate scaling of this kind of seaweed.” The type of algae in question is a red seaweed called Asparagopsis, and it grows wild in many parts of the world. Researchers from the University of California, Davis, found earlier this year that methane emissions were reduced by 24 to 58 percent in a dozen cows that ate one variety of the seaweed, depending on dose. The seaweed constituted only a small percentage of the cows’ food, but researchers found that the dent it could make in emissions would be significant if it were available to farmers. The methane from cow’s burps makes up 25 percent of methane emissions in the U.S., according to the university. The seaweed interrupts the bacterial process of producing methane in their guts, Goldman said. Challenges remain, said Ermias Kebreab, a professor of animal science at UC Davis. The seaweed needs more tests to determine if it would impact meat and milk quality from the animals. The challenge of producing enough of the seaweed is staggering, leading Goldman to call it an “aquatic moonshot.” He estimated that the amount of seaweed needed to reach every cattle operation would be greater than the amount presently farmed in the world. “We need to have a consistent product. We need to find a way to grow it in a more consistent way,” Kebreab said. That’s exactly what Australis Aquaculture is working on. The company has collected different strains of Asparagopsis seaweed to establish a seed bank of seaweeds that can grow in different climates, Goldman said. The next step will be to reproduce the seaweed on the company’s farms, Goldman said. Creating the seed bank will make it possible for farmers to grow the seaweed elsewhere, he said. The effort has attracted the attention of the World Bank, said its senior aquaculture specialist Randall Brummett. He said scaling up farming of the seaweed in the developing world could make livestock operations more climate-friendly and boost the economies of poorer nations. Skeptics remain. The seaweed has yet to be proven palatable to cows, and the milk that they would yield hasn’t proven to be safe for human consumption, said Frank Mitloehner, a professor and air quality extension specialist in the animal science department at UC Davis. “When you look at it a little deeper, some serious concerns have to be addressed before it can be considered a serious mitigation tool,” he said. There’s also the question of whether it will find acceptance with farmers. Jenni Tilton-Flood, a dairy farmer at Flood Brothers Farm in Clinton, Maine, said she’d be willing to try it, but cost and availability are also important. “As long as the nutrition would be valuable to our animals. We don’t just throw food at our cows. We have nutritionists for our cows,” she said. “If it can be a food source for livestock, that’s great.”",bad,seaweed aquaculture,2018,Maine
92,10322,The Wrap: Southern flair expected in this year's Maine Restaurant Week - Portland Press Herald,"The Seaweed Festival returns while beer continues its boom.  The heart of Maine Restaurant Week, which runs from March 1-12 this year, is in the juicy details. And we have some of them for you, starting with the Incredible Breakfast Cook-Off, which is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year with a dozen competitors and – as usual – lots of pork belly, lobster and eggs. If you love breakfast and have never been to this event, you’re missing out. The cook-off is scheduled for 7 to 9 a.m. Feb. 28 at Sea Dog Brewing in South Portland. Buy tickets, $25, at mainerestaurantweek.com/events. Here’s a preview: Chef Gil Plaster of BlueFin, the restaurant in the Portland Harbor Hotel, will be making a pork belly Benedict with a cheddar–Old Bay biscuit, chipotle hollandaise and crispy pork belly. Can’t get enough pork belly' Kenneth MacDonald, chef at Congress Squared in the Westin Harborview Hotel, plans to bring pork belly and lobster spring rolls. The most interesting item (at least from this Southern transplant’s perspective): a Maine Breakfast Tot from chef Melanie Houston at the Sebasco Harbor Resort. It’s made with Aroostook Maine potatoes, Pineland Farm cheddar, eggs, red eye gravy and Bisson Farm spicy sausage. Red eye gravy, for you Yankees who may not know it, is a Southern thing, made from the drippings of country ham mixed with black coffee – in this case, coffee from Coffee By Design. A few restaurants are planning their own special events to coincide with Restaurant Week. To mark its 20th year as “Portland’s original small plates restaurant,” Local 188 plans to launch its celebration with “A Trip Through Spain,” a 10-course tapas menu with wine pairings for $55. Up the coast in Camden, Natalie’s Restaurant is planning a March 3 Turkish-themed dinner helmed by the restaurant’s executive sous chef, who is from Istanbul. On March 9, the restaurant will hold a Venezuelan dinner, with all proceeds going to non-profit Caritas de Venezuela. For more details, contact the restaurant. GETTING YOUR KELP ON  The day-long Maine Seaweed Festival drew thousands of seaweed lovers to South Portland in 2014 and 2015 before it was canceled because of a rift between organizers and seaweed harvesters. Now a new and longer celebration of seaweed is in the works. Josh Rogers, owner of Heritage Seaweed on India Street in Portland, is organizing Seaweed Week: A Food and Drink Celebration of Maine’s Kelp Harvest, to be held April 26-May 4. About 25 businesses have signed up to participate so far, from seaweed retailers to restaurants and craft breweries. Find more details at Seaweed Week promotional tables located at Fork Food Lab March 8 and at Maine Craft Distilling March 15. UMM, NOT THIS YEAR Taste of the Nation update: A couple of weeks ago I wrote that the Taste of the Nation dinner benefiting the fight to end childhood hunger would be returning to Portland March 15 after a three-year hiatus. I hope this news doesn’t give any of you whiplash, but I heard from the director of Taste of the Nation, Jessie Niewold, that this year’s event has also been canceled “in order to focus on our programmatic work in the state. For now, we are working with terrific local partners to connect hungry kids in Maine to the food they need, like school breakfast.” Another factor may have been lack of interest. As of a couple of weeks ago, the only restaurants committed to the event were Big Tree Hospitality, which owns restaurants in Portland and Boston; Earth at Hidden Pond in Kennebunkport; and Raleigh in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. A bad storm in 2015 forced the cancellation of the event, which typically raised $150,000 to $200,000 for the national Share Our Strength program as well as local hunger prevention programs. Niewold said that while the March 15 event has been canceled, “we look forward to bringing Taste of the Nation back to Portland in the coming years.” REVENUES ON TAP  The owners of the Maine Brew Bus looked in the rear view mirror recently and came up with some interesting stats about their business last year. In 2018, the bus drove 17,883 miles, carrying 7,331 customers to breweries and distilleries around the state. Those customers hailed from 44 states, four Canadian provinces and 11 countries (12 if you count the United States). Brew Bus guests spent a total of $62,942 at their tour stops, on top of the $109,162 paid by the business in tasting and food fees. That’s a lot of beer.",neutral,seaweed aquaculture,2019,Maine
93,10348,UNE researchers harvest kelp from farm in Saco Bay - Portland Press Herald,"The goal is to grow the algae on a large scale in the open ocean as a source of biofuel.  BIDDEFORD — Just past Ram Island a mile out into Saco Bay, a University of New England boat pitched and bobbed in the choppy surf as a team of researchers hoisted a rope covered in 2 tons of kelp from the water. The long ribbons of brown seaweed glistened in the sun as they dangled from the rope on which they had been growing all winter. Working quickly, the researchers used small knives to slice the kelp – picture 10-foot lasagna noodles – from the rope and store it in large coolers stacked on deck. Within a few hours, the team of a half-dozen researchers and students had harvested about 2 tons of kelp that grew on 400 feet of rope. “Less than five months ago when we put this algae out in the water they were 2 to 3 millimeters long. In a few months they grew to something taller than I am,” said Adam St. Gelais, a research scientist from UNE. “We just occupied a little bit of ocean space and created this impressive amount of biomass in a short amount of time.” The harvest was the first at this kelp farm in Saco Bay as researchers from UNE study how to farm kelp in open ocean conditions. The project is funded by a three-year, $1.3 million research grant from the U.S. Department of Energy. The grant is part of a new program called Macroalgae Research Inspiring Novel Energy Resources, or MARINER, that aims to position the United States as a leading producer of seaweed to help improve energy security and economic competitiveness. The goal of the MARINER project is to develop kelp as a source of biofuel. But to achieve this goal, significant advances need to be made in productivity and cost of all phases of kelp farming. The UNE researchers hope the work they’re doing will also help the growing aquaculture industry in Maine, potentially allowing more people to farm kelp in open water and away from the busy shoreline. There are currently about a dozen aquaculture sites for farming marine algae, including kelp, along the Maine coast, according to the Department of Marine Resources. “Maine has this incredibly vast coastline – 3,500 miles of coastline – and we could have seaweed farms all over the place in fairly protected areas. But actually in-shore Gulf of Maine is a really busy place. We have shipping lanes, we have recreational boaters, we have lobstermen, so there are only so many places where you can tuck a seaweed farm by an island and have a nice protected place to be,” St. Gelais said. Seaweed can be used as raw material for transportation fuels, chemicals, food and other commercial products without competing with food crops for land and water, according to the researchers. The UNE team is developing a fine-tuned 3D modeling tool to simulate hydrodynamic-induced mechanical stresses that seaweed farms face in the open ocean. The team will use its modeling expertise to determine the structural performance of new and existing farm designs in the Gulf of Maine. The model will be capable of simulating hectare-sized farms, which would speed up the engineering, testing and permitting process for new, large-scale seaweed farming systems, according to the university. “This is our first test to see if our engineering could truly survive open ocean conditions,” said Barry Costa-Pierce, executive director of UNE North. “It’s really important.” The UNE kelp farm, located just past Ram Island, went into the water in January. Typically, kelp farming is done from October to May, said St. Gelais, the project coordinator for the MARINER grant at UNE. That allows the equipment used to in the operation to be removed from the water before the lobstering season begins. Late last summer, researchers in the seaweed research lab and nursery on the Biddeford campus harvested parent kelp from the Gulf of Maine. Back in the lab, they created baby seaweed that settled onto twine. “Picture a spool of twine completely covered in brown fuzz,” St. Gelais said. The researchers then wrapped that twine around a larger rope that serves as the relatively simple underwater farm for the seaweed. In January, the line covered in kelp seed was attached to multiple buoys to keep the kelp at the depth it likes, about 2 meters below the surface. The entire setup was anchored to the ocean floor in a spot where the depth ranges from 45 to 55 feet, depending on the tide. St. Gelais said his team is working on how to engineer the farm to survive in rough open water conditions. The rope the team used this year is a little thicker than the rope people are already using to farm kelp. Over the three years of the project, the team will test various farm configurations at the site, collecting real-time data that will be analyzed by the researchers involved with the project. Sensors attached to the equipment track things such as waves and currents, providing data that is used to create a computer model to evaluate how well a kelp farm would perform in open ocean conditions. “Our goals is to make something that will survive storms without costing millions and millions of dollars,” said Toby Dewhurst of Maine Marine Composites, a partner on the project. While the MARINER project is focused on developing tools to enable the United States to become a global leader in the production of marine biomass, the researchers from UNE and Maine Marine Composites say the work they are doing could have an impact on kelp farming in Maine. “We’re in a revolutionary stage right now with these organisms,” Costa-Pierce said. “If we find a way to grow them en masse this time of year, we’re not in conflict with the lobstering industry. We’re providing potentially a winter livelihood for the lobster families to earn additional cash in the winter.” Next year, the kelp farm will expand to 4 acres at the same spot in Saco Bay as researchers continue to investigate how to efficiently and cost-effectively grow kelp in the open ocean. A day after the harvest, St. Gelais was still excited about the kelp his team grew in Saco Bay. The kelp itself was clean, with few other organisms attached, and grew quickly given that the farm was put into the water late in the season. After the researchers finished their work, they headed up the Saco River to deliver the crop to the processor who will use it for food products. As the team offloaded their crop, the only other boat nearby pulled up and the man on board asked them what they were doing. When St. Gelais told him about the project, the man said he had just harvested his own kelp farm in Freeport the day before. “I would have been shocked a few years ago to run into a kelp farmer,” St. Gelais said. “It’s becoming more and more common to run into people engaging in this new aquaculture opportunity. It’s starting to gain steam, which is exciting.”",good,seaweed aquaculture,2019,Maine
94,10396,"Pioneering mussel farmer buys rival, plans expansion - Portland Press Herald","By 2021, Bangs Island Mussels plans to more than double production and hire more than 10 new employees, reflecting a growing market for the Casco Bay-grown mussels.	 A company known for bringing innovation to Maine’s aquaculture scene plans to more than double production and expand its workforce after buying nearby shellfish and kelp farms in Casco Bay. Bangs Island Mussels, a Portland aquaculture company, says it needs to scale up its business to meet demand for its rope-grown mussels. The sale comes as Maine-farmed mussels hit a 10-year high for value and production, prompting talk of Maine-grown mussels taking market share from Canada. “We have been a very small company for a long time. It is hard to operate as a small company when you have so many expenses,” owner Matt Moretti said in an interview. “Particularly in aquaculture, it is not the easiest industry to operate,” Moretti added. “By growing to an appropriate scale, it just makes everything better.” Employees of Bangs Island Mussels sort blue mussels as they travel down a conveyor belt.  Ben McCanna/Staff Photographer  It was founded 20 years ago, and since then has continued to innovate, most recently striking up a partnership with the University of New England to research the diet and stresses on mussels to better understand their growth rates and tissue quality. Since incorporation, Bangs Island has worked the same handful of acres near Chebeague Island in Casco Bay. The company grows mussels and kelp from ropes suspended beneath rafts. The efficient system grows tens of thousands of pounds of mussels in a small space. Bangs Island produced about 266,000 pounds last year, Moretti said. But beginning this year, Bangs Island expanded its leased space from 8 acres to about 23 acres in waters around Falmouth and Chebeague Island. It now farms an area roughly the size of 30 football fields. Last winter, the company bought about 4 acres of kelp farms from Ocean Approved and received state approval for an 11-acre lease in March. It bought another 5.75 acres of rope-grown mussel farms this fall from Calendar Island Mussels. Bangs Island plans to add seven rafts to a maximum build-out of 28 by early next year and bring full production to at least 750,000 pounds a year by 2021. Moretti hopes to grow his full-time workforce from four employees to at least 15. Moretti and his father bought the company from its founder in 2010. “We are trying to achieve a much more efficient scale,” he said. “Do what we have been doing for the last nine years, but bigger and better.” DIVERSE BUSINESSES, SPECIES Blue mussels account for a sliver of the state’s $71.7 million aquaculture harvest, but landings and value have grown dramatically in the last decade. In 2018, Maine blue mussel farms landed 2.1 million pounds worth $3.2 million, according to the Department of Marine Resources, more than twice the value a decade ago. The dock value may not represent the value of mussels after they are cleaned, processed and packaged. Rope-grown mussels fetch a higher market price, about $2, than those farmed on the bottom, about $1.50, or wild-harvested, 90 cents. Some consolidation in Maine’s growing aquaculture industry is expected, but Sebastian Belle, executive director of the Maine Aquaculture Association, doesn’t think the Bangs Island deal indicates a trend of big companies dominating the industry. Despite its expansion, Bangs Island is still a small concern compared to big producers in Canada and elsewhere. “I think the more important trend, frankly, is the entrance of new producers into the sector,” Belle said. In the last decade, the state approved 79 new commercial aquaculture leases and 764 limited-purpose leases, almost seven times the limited-purpose leases given out between 2002 and 2010, according to figures provided by the marine resources department. Dave Fogg weighs a bag of mussels at Bangs Island Mussels.  Ben McCanna/Staff Photographer  Limited-purpose leases are yearlong, 400-square-foot areas for people starting out in the industry. Most of the leases are for shellfish and seaweed. “The strength of the Maine aquaculture sector is the diversity in species and company sizes,” Belle said. “Instead of being a monolithic sector, we have a diverse one that will allow us to grow and adapt to changing circumstances in the market and in regards to climate change.” TAKING MARKET SHARE FROM CANADA A 2016 report from the Gulf of Maine Research Institute projected Maine could become an important player in U.S. mussel cultivation. North American demand for farmed mussels has grown in recent decades but is mainly filled by imported shellfish from Prince Edward Island in Canada. The island’s industry produces 40 million pounds of mussels a year and employs 1,500 people, according to the provincial government. But discerning chefs and consumers prize Maine mussels because they are bigger, meatier and benefit from the state’s reputation for quality seafood, said Jonathan Labaree, chief community officer at Gulf of Maine Research Institute. “More people are eating mussels, and there is good opportunity to Maine to take some market share away from Canada,” Labaree said. The report projects the value of Maine’s rope-harvested mussel harvest could be $15 million a year by 2030. Despite the promise of the industry, only a handful of small companies farm mussels. Starting a rope-farmed mussel business is expensive and involves off-shore equipment and infrastructure, Labaree said. Startup farms have had a hard time getting financing from banks and other conventional lenders unfamiliar with the business and concerned with risk. Oyster farming is comparatively easier and cheaper to get into, Labaree said, as evidenced by the many oyster companies that have sprung up in the last five years. “Mussels are just a harder business to get into,” Labaree said. “I suspect we’ll see more as time goes on.” Peter Stocks, the former owner of Calendar Island Mussels, said selling to Bangs Island was the right move for both companies. Stocks began growing mussels around the same time Moretti bought his company and has since branched out to farming scallops. He felt it was time to focus on a single product and also for one of the companies to expand rapidly, Stocks said. With a current two-year waiting time for state lease approval, the fastest way to scale aquaculture is to buy out existing leases, along with equipment and customers, Stocks added. “The economics of it are such that the faster you can add on volume to your production, the sooner your costs drop and profits go up,” he said.",good,seaweed aquaculture,2019,Maine
95,10516,Bowdoin College experiment looks to test relationship between oysters and seagrass - Portland Press Herald,"Students and staff hypothesize that the seagrass will help the growth of oysters, which could have a positive impact of Maine's booming aquaculture industry.	 A bucket containing seagrass and oysters involved in a Bowdoin College experiment.  C. Thacher Carter / The Times Record  An experiment being conducted by Bowdoin College students and faculty will test if there is a positive relationship between oyster growth and seagrass meadows – a finding that, if true, could potentially aid the state’s booming aquaculture industry. The month-long experiment is taking place at Bowdoin College’s Schiller Coastal Studies Center on Orr’s Island and uses seven-gallon buckets containing oysters that are filled with water varying in temperature, acidity and seagrass quantity. The project also has a field component, where oysters were placed in a nearby cove in different locations relative to seagrass meadows. Bowdoin College junior Fiona Ralph inspects an oyster tray involved in an experiment that tests the relationship between sea grass and oysters.  C. Thacher Carter / The Times Record  The Quahag Bay Conservancy, the organization that runs Snow Island Oyster, is also collaborating with Bowdoin on the project. Snow Island Oyster grows between 600,000 and 1 million oysters a year through a nearby aquaculture operation. Ultimately, those working on the experiment think the project will show that seagrass helps oysters grow. “We expect that the oysters are going to grow faster in the presence of seagrass and that the seagrass is going to grow faster in the presence of oysters,” said Bowdoin College Biology Professor and Schiller Coastal Studies Center Director David Carlon. “It’s a result that could be used to design essentially permits or design a layout for an aquaculture system.” Carlon said that when seagrass is photosynthesizing, it acts as a sink for carbon dioxide — a greenhouse gas —  and buffers the acidity of the seawater in a way that could be favorable for oysters. In turn, the oysters nitrogen byproduct could act as a fertilizer for and promote the growth of the seagrass. Seagrass is a form of underwater plant life distinct from seaweed that provides habitat for different marine species. The aquaculture industry is on the rise in Maine, and there are currently 172 licensed operations in the state, which translates to just over 1,663 acres. Of that, over 615 acres or 102 operations are cultivating the American oyster – the same species in the experiment. Bowdoin College students Fiona Ralph and Eban Charles.  C. Thacher Carter / The Times Record  According to Carlon, some of the bucket’s temperature and acidity are also adjusted for where the Gulf of Maine is expected to be in the year 2100 due to climate change. “What’s the most important issue of our time' I mean I think you could say it’s climate change,” Carlon said. “Another important issue of our time is sustainable food … we have to think more carefully about what kind of aquaculture systems will support local economies.” The two Bowdoin College students who are working on the experiment for the summer are Eban Charles, a rising junior who grew up in Waterville, and Fiona Ralph, a rising second-semester junior who is from New Jersey. Charles said other components that the experiment will attempt to measure include shell size and strength, seagrass length and water chemistry conditions. “There’s a lot to decipher.” Charles said. “Say the shells grow a lot but the meat doesn’t. That’s something that’s relevant because that’s not exactly what the world of aquaculture cares about – they want the meat.” “Honestly, every week I would say has been very different,” Ralph said, detailing the work it took to build the plumbing system, organizing the field component and finally launching the experiment with the oysters. Ralph added that the hands-on project has been particularly enjoyable after months of remote learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic. “As a science major, having to do labs online and science classes online, just as it is with everyone, is just so challenging,” Ralph added. Once the experiment is complete, the group plans to submit the findings to a peer-reviewed scientific journal.

96,10562,"The Wrap: Maine Seaweed Week, Fermentation Fair, and more praise for Portland restaurants - Portland Press Herald","The fourth annual Maine Seaweed Week kicks off Friday, on Earth Day, with a party at Oxbow Blending & Bottling, 49 Washington Ave., in Portland, featuring Oxbow’s kelp beer launch and demos led by seaweed farmers and scientists. The free kickoff party runs from 5 to 9 p.m., with demonstrations scheduled for the first 90 minutes. Seaweed Week runs through May 1. The event had been curtailed during the last two years of the pandemic, but returns this year in full force, with more than 75 bars and restaurants offering special dishes and drinks using savory, umami-rich seaweed, as well as five breweries tapped to create special beers. The event website lists participating venues. “People tend to like seaweed when they try it, but they don’t have a lot of opportunities to try it,” said Maine Seaweed Week founder Josh Rogers of Heritage Seaweed, explaining the importance of having area chefs and mixologists show event goers exactly how delicious the abundant ingredient can be. “They’ll be using it to make everything from burgers, hot dogs and pizza to thoughtfully plated, farm-to-table dishes. I love that it shows the truly broad range of possible uses for seaweed.” In a bit of scheduling serendipity, the Northeast Aquaculture Conference & Exposition is convening jointly with the Milford Aquaculture Seminar April 27-29 in Portland, meaning Seaweed Week will be a potential must-see for boatloads of seaweed farmers, scientists and other experts already in town for the expo. “It’s probably the single most sustainable crop you can grow,” Rogers said, contrasting it with organic produce, which requires open land and lots of fresh water. As seaweed grows, Rogers said, it improves seawater quality by lowering acidification that weakens shellfish shells. “We really need to be scaling up our seaweed farming. It’s transforming the working waterfront.” Jaclyn Robidoux, co-organizer of both Maine Seaweed Week and the aquaculture expo, said Maine has about 30 seaweed farms, up from one farm just a decade ago. “We’ve definitely seen a jump in the last 10 years. Before that, there were no seaweed farmers mostly because there were no seaweed buyers,” Robidoux said. Rogers noted Maine’s long history with seaweed as an ingredient. “It’s always been part of the local diet, going back to the Indigenous peoples,” Rogers said. Indeed, New England’s first nature guidebook – dating back to 1672 – lists numerous culinary and medicinal uses for seaweed, many gleaned from Native Americans. Rogers said Seaweed Week “is a little offbeat, but it’s very important, and people are excited about the event being in Maine.” Fermentation Fair at Oxbow Nicholas Repenning of Go-en Fermented Foods presents some of his miso and koji products to Fermentation Fair goers in 2020 at Bunker Brewing Co. in Portland.  Alden Robinson  Fermentation Fair is slated for Wednesday from 5 to 7 p.m. at Oxbow Blending & Bottling in Portland. The fair features eight presenters, from restaurant chefs to home-process experts, explaining their methods for making koji, yogurt, kimchi, vinegar, sourdough bread, wild and organic wines, and other fermented foods. “There are so many fermented foods being made right now in Maine, and just a crazy variety,” said Eileen Murphy, co-director of the local nonprofit The Resilience Hub, which is putting on the fair for the third year since 2019. “There’s some fermented food I haven’t even heard of that will be there, so I think it’ll be a great learning experience for everyone there.” Murphy said the fair wasn’t held last year because of the pandemic. But fermented-food fans can take heart – The Resilience Hub intends to hold the fair annually again. “We’re trying to get even more people involved in the future,” Murphy said, adding that she feels fermented foods are on the rise in Maine. She attributes their growing popularity to the fundamental combination of science and food. “I know first hand how tricky fermentation can be, though,” Murphy said. “So the fair is a great opportunity to ask fermentation experts about their processes, and learn so much more about it.” The Fermentation Fair is free and open to the public. More good press for Portland dining Portland restaurants earned another major magazine story, this time in Conde Nast Traveler, which ran a roundup last month of “The 15 Best Restaurants in Portland, Maine.” “These days, Portland is a jumble of creative and scrappy spots that make snacking your way around town an utter delight. That said, when you want the complete dining experience of a sit-down-and-linger meal that will haunt your dreams, these are the restaurants to be reckoned with,” the story proclaims, before offering writeups on Solo Italiano, Union at The Press Hotel, The Honey Paw, Woodford Food & Beverage, Central Provisions, Via Vecchia, Scales, Fore Street, Baharat, Eventide Oyster Co., Chaval, Izakaya Minato, Pai Men Miyake, Terlingua and Street & Co. The Conde Nast Traveler piece also offers an explanation of how this small city developed such a giant reputation for fine food. “The state’s proud lack of pretense and its close-knit community of small farms, working waterfronts, and independent restaurants are long-held traditions that predate (and frankly, eclipse) hype phrases like ‘locavorism.’ And it means not only widespread access to far better food for everyone, but that celebrated fine dining here tends to eschew anything high-concept, and instead just keep it real,” the story states. Portland Farmers’ Market headed outside As its indoor winter season draws to a close, the Portland Farmers’ Market will be held Wednesdays and Saturdays in Deering Oaks from April 27 until Nov. 23. This Saturday will be the last indoor market of the year in the gymnasium at the Stevens Square Community Center at 631 Stevens Ave. The summer market will remain at Deering Oaks except between May 18 and June 15, when it will move to Payson Park while the city treats trees at Deering Oaks for an infestation of browntail moths, according to Portland Farmers’ Market Association President Caitlin Jordan.",good,seaweed aquaculture,2022,Maine
97,10589,Seaweed helps Maine lobstermen ride the storm of climate change - Portland Press Herald,"It’s harvest time on Casco Bay. Briana Warner is dressed for this late spring morning in padded rubber overalls, raincoat, rubber boots and neon yellow gloves that come up above her elbows. Just off the coast of Falmouth, she hangs off the side of a Zodiac boat and uses a gaff (hook) to hoist from the water a neon green buoy attached to a thick white rope. Warner struggles and finally gets her hands around the rope. The line drips with long, shimmering, translucent ribbons of green sugar kelp. Warner’s face lights up as she inspects the seaweed. “They’re ready for harvest,” she declares. As the CEO and president of Atlantic Sea Farms, the 38-year-old Warner is using seaweed to quietly revolutionize Maine’s struggling fishing industry. Up and down the Maine coast, thousands of lines like this have been planted by fishermen growing seaweed in partnership with her company. In the fall, the fishermen plant tiny kelp seeds on the 1,000-foot-long ropes, and by late spring, attached to each one is close to 6,000 pounds of fresh sugar kelp. The seaweed is harvested, flash frozen and used to make kelp cubes for smoothies, as well as seaweed salad, seaweed kraut and more. Seaweed is Maine’s new cash crop. For generations, coastal Maine has been supported by a different underwater resource: the lobster. Lobstering is woven into virtually every aspect of life in coastal communities; tax revenue, jobs, and the state’s identity all depend on it. But as climate change causes Maine’s coastal waters to warm, underwater life, and the economy built around it, has shifted dramatically. The Gulf of Maine is warming faster than 96 percent of the world’s oceans – increasing at a rate of 0.09 degrees per year. These warming temperatures have forced the lobster population to migrate north seeking colder waters, and the impact on Maine fishermen has been profound. Atlantic Sea Farms partner farmer Keith Miller paints lobster buoys in preparation of fishing season in St. George in April.  Photo by Nicole Wolf  Keith Miller, 67, a second-generation lobsterman, has been lobstering for more than 50 years, fishing in Wheeler’s Bay between Spruce Head and Tenants Harbor. When he saw the dramatic impact of climate change on his industry he knew he had to plan for the six months of the year – between fall and spring – when he couldn’t fish for lobster. He heard about a program in Rockland, Maine, at the Island Institute (which helps coastal communities thrive) educating lobstermen about aquaculture. “I could choose between oyster farming, mussel farming or kelp,” says Miller in his thick Maine accent. “Water ’round here is too shallow for mussels, and oysters are a year-round job. I wanted to keep lobstering half the year, so I chose seaweed.” At the time, Warner was the Island Institute’s first economic development officer. A former Foreign Service diplomat, she says she’s always been interested in “finding solutions rather than being part of the problem.” After serving in Libya, Guinea and several other countries, she moved to Maine with her husband (who grew up in the state) and started a family. Her goal was to apply her diplomatic skills to making a difference in the state’s coastal and food communities. “The question we asked was this: In communities where lobster is everything, how do we prepare for the future along the Maine coast and diversify to face climate change'” says Warner. “When you’re self-employed and your entire community is dependent on one industry, and you’re totally at the whim of Mother Nature, overdependence on one monoculture is very scary.” Miller is one of several dozen lobstermen accepted into the aquaculture program. He describes the last five years he’s spent farming seaweed in the “offseason” as “life changing.” “My first year kelping I brought in 2,200 pounds,” he says. “But this year my harvest was 170,000 pounds. I keep telling folks, ‘My ship is coming in!'” Briana Warner, president and chief executive of Atlantic Sea Farms, in Cumberland.  Photo by Nicole Wolf  In summer 2018, Warner was offered the position of CEO at Atlantic Sea Farms. When she started, two kelp farms were yielding around 30,000 pounds total. The company now works with 27 partner “farmers,” and the 2022 harvest brought in just under 1 million pounds of seaweed. The company’s products are now sold in more than 2,000 stores across the country, as well as in restaurants and college cafeterias. In 2021 the company was responsible for 85 percent of the line-produced seaweed in the country. Another farmer the company works with is Justin Papkee, 31, who fishes near Long Island in Casco Bay. “This country is way behind others in understanding how good kelp is for you and the environment,” Papkee says. “Briana is doing a great job figuring out ways to market it.” Papkee, who still lobsters year-round and farms kelp a few days a week during the harvest season, says he’s able to maintain his crew of three year-round and bring in extra income. Although he’s hesitant to talk about money, he says this year, after four seasons of kelp farming, he is “in the black.” Warner calls seaweed “a shock absorber against the volatility of the lobster industry.” When she talks about seaweed and the industry, her speech gains momentum and her passion is on display. “The best thing about kelp is that it is the most climate-friendly food you can eat!” Seaweed, she explains, is farmed without land, pesticides or fresh water. The environmental benefits of growing seaweed go even further. “There’s so much carbon in the air, and when carbon hits the ocean surface the ocean absorbs it and changes the pH and degrades shellfish,” explains Warner. “Seaweed absorbs the carbon and nitrogen in the water. When you harvest seaweed you are removing carbon with it and leaving behind a healthier body of water.” Warner is quick to point out that growing seaweed is not a climate change solution. “It is,” she explains, “a climate change adaptation strategy. It is better than anything else we can eat.” But seaweed, Warner says, can have a massive local climate change effect. To illustrate her point, she says that when mussels are planted on ropes underwater after a kelp harvest, the shell strength is almost twice as strong in those areas, thanks to the removal of the excess carbon. Until recently, seaweed was always sold dried and, most often, came from Asia or was harvested from the wild in U.S. waters. Atlantic Sea Farms is one of several American companies that sells seaweed that is never dyed or dried. After it is flash frozen it’s used to make kelp cubes, a nutritious boost to smoothies, salad dressings and sauces. In raw form the seaweed adds crunch and a briny, umami-rich flavor to seaweed salad, Sea-Beet Kraut, and a take on kimchi called Sea-Chi. According to Lia Heifetz, 31, of Barnacle Foods in Juneau, Alaska, “seaweed is an ocean multivitamin.” It’s rich in potassium, iron, magnesium, calcium and antioxidants. Heifetz and her two partners harvest wild bull kelp seaweed (which is prolific around the shores of Juneau) as well as farmed kelp. Bull kelp is unique because it can grow a stipe (or stem) that is 30 feet long, and, according to Heifetz, offers a unique texture and flavor similar to apples and fresh bell pepper. Barnacle Foods freezes the kelp and uses it to make hot sauce, salsa, pickles, Bloody Mary mixes and more. Heifetz hopes to increase the amount of kelp farming they do in coming years, but says in Alaska and many other parts of the country obtaining permits and licenses involves lengthy hurdles. “We have a unique opportunity here in Alaska,” she says. “We have 30,000 miles of coast in the state, primarily undeveloped. Consumers are looking for a way to use their food dollars to support causes that are important to them. And seaweed checks all the boxes.” Warner has also been spreading the word about the power of seaweed. She was recently invited to the 2022 Davos World Economic Forum to speak as part of a program for 20 “ecopreneurs.” She focused her talk on America’s “broken food system” and the potential for Maine’s seaweed aquaculture industry as “a model where people and the planet come first.” But mostly, she says, she tried to leave the top leaders who attended the annual summit with something positive. “What we’re doing with seaweed in Maine,” she told them, “is giving people hope and giving people an opportunity to take hold of their own future in the face of a very uncertain climate.”",good,seaweed aquaculture,2022,Maine
98,10593,Commentary: Maine is already a world leader in seaweed aquaculture. The only way is up.  - Portland Press Herald,"Maine has long been known for our breathtaking coastlines and forests, our lobsters, our blueberries and, more recently, our ridiculously good beer. But Maine is now getting national and global attention for something that you might not expect: seaweed aquaculture. Maine’s wild harvest seaweed industry has long been supplying the world with sustainable seaweed from the clean, cold waters of Maine. In the last four years, however, Maine’s fishermen have steadily and quietly become the U.S. leaders in seaweed aquaculture. Justin Papkee, a partner farmer with Atlantic Sea Farms, hauls up kelp lines with the help of his crew, Jim Ranaghan and Chris Papkee, off Long Island in 2021. Maine’s working waterfront communities grew more than 85 percent of the cultivated seaweed in the entire U.S. in 2021. Photo by Nicole Wolf  Briana Warner is CEO of Atlantic Sea Farms, a kelp aquaculture company based in Biddeford. To put a finer point on it: Maine’s working waterfront communities grew more than 85 percent of the cultivated seaweed in the entire U.S. in 2021. Seaweed farming is positive and additive and is done with no inputs, no arable land and no fresh water; it helps improve the ocean by removing carbon and nitrogen from the water column. It is the most climate-friendly food on the planet and is rich with nutrients and minerals. In Maine, it’s helping working waterfront communities not only mitigate some of the effects of climate change, but also adapt to a changing ocean as wild fisheries become increasingly volatile. And here’s the best part: Maine is in the position to continue to be the leader in the production of this superfood, all the while making our coastal communities and oceans more resilient. We have more coastline than the state of California; more than 4,000 lobster license holders who can farm kelp in their off-season, and a deep desire to ensure that our fishing communities are able to continue to work on the water for generations to come. Maine’s fishermen and aquaculturists already have the necessary infrastructure, skills and strong ethos of innovation, quality and stewardship that makes them outstanding kelp farmers. And with 98 percent of the seaweed eaten in the U.S. coming from untraceable sources overseas, the domestic market is ready for more Maine products. We are just scratching the surface of the positive impact that seaweed farms can have on our food systems, ocean and coastal communities. The world is taking notice that something different, positive and exciting is happening here – and that this sea change is being owned by Mainers. This week, Maine welcomes the Seagriculture Conference, the leading global seaweed industry conference. People are coming to Maine because they want to learn from Mainers about how to build a sustainable aquaculture industry in their own states and countries – and because they want to buy regenerative seaweed from Maine. We are excited to welcome the conference to our state and show that economic development and climate change adaptation can be most effective when people are empowered to make their own future. Just look at Maine’s fishermen and mussel farmers who have quietly gotten to work, innovated and turned Maine into a national leader in aquaculture when everyone else was focused on large offshore farms and robotic equipment. To continue expanding the opportunities for Maine’s fishing communities to grow kelp and improve the oceans, we’re going to need Mainers’ help. We cannot be beholden to wealthy oceanfront property owners who would rather gentrify our coast than see communities continue to work on the water. We need to give our regulators at the Department of Marine Resources the resources to move our industry forward by processing strong and compliant aquaculture lease applications in a reasonable timeframe. We need to continue to show the world that truly sustainable food doesn’t come from a lab, it comes from the clean cold waters of Maine and is grown by fishermen. Let’s prove to the world that we can grow food better here – food that is good for the planet, the consumer and our fishing communities.",good,seaweed aquaculture,2022,Maine

The Washington Street brewery specializes in complex-tasting lagers brewed using old-world Czech methods and equipment. Since the Sept. 1 launch, beer fans have left mostly positive reviews of the new brewery’s pale and dark lagers on the brew-tasting app Untappd. “Delicious, crushable lager,” wrote one, while another happy customer said his beer was “everything I look for in a lager – crisp, dry, subtle sweetness/bitter balance.” Sacred Profane’s beer – crafted by head brewer Brienne Allan and operations manger Michael Fava – has dominated talk about the brewery for months now, but the European beer hall food appears to have earned plenty of praise on its own since last Thursday. Sacred Profane partner Erin Sheehan said the menu was influenced by Eastern European pub fare and includes dishes like crispy pork schnitzel and beef tartare. Customers can also find some French Canadian treats as well, like cretons – similar to pork rillettes – and poutine. “Lots of people’s grandmothers made this food for them, it’s very nostalgic, and so we wanted to make sure it was great,” Sheehan said. “We’ve had an excellent response to it so far.” Sheehan’s husband, Sacred Profane partner Carson James, serves as the brewery’s chef.

SEAWEED CONFERENCE COMES TO TOWN The first international Seagriculture Conference comes to Portland on Wednesday and Thursday, drawing roughly 300 attendees from around North America and Europe to examine the future of ocean plant life and the seaweed industry. The Seagriculture Conference has been held annually in Europe since 2012. Conference organizers said they chose Maine as the location to launch their new Seagriculture Conference USA series in part because the state is a “hot spot for the seaweed industry in North America.” The sold-out, two-day gathering is based at the Westin Portland Harborview and features 27 speakers on topics such as using seaweed to benefit the climate, innovations in seaweed farming and processing, and framing ocean plants as a natural capital investment. Maine-based speakers include Everything Seaweed President Jessica Chalmers to discuss manufacturing seaweed nano-fibers, activist Severine Fleming to describe a right-sized seaweed economy, and Atlantic Farms CEO Briana Warner, who will talk about how line-grown seaweed is an umami-rich superfood. Biddeford-based Atlantic Sea Farms will close out the conference Thursday with a live-cooking demo. MAINE ORCHARDS MAKE THE LIST Cayford Orchards in Skowhegan and Super Chilly Farm in Palermo were the two Maine apple orchards included in Yankee magazine’s list of the 13 best orchards in New England. Two Maine apple orchards made Yankee magazine’s list of the 13 Best Apple Orchards in New England. Cayford Orchards in Skowhegan and Super Chilly Farm in Palermo were Maine’s honorees on the regional list, compiled by Amy Traverso, Yankee senior food editor and author of “The Apple Lover’s Cookbook.” Traverso noted that Cayford owners Jason and Heather Davis have been reviving and adding to their heirloom apple trees on the 18-acre orchard since the 1990s, allowing the orchard to offer heirloom varieties alongside mainstream apples like Cortland and Honeycrisp. Cayford has operated for six generations, and Traverso writes that for the Davises, “this work is rooted in a passion for preserving their family’s heritage as well as that of the apple itself.” The list says Super Chilly Farm is not a typical pick-your-own orchard, but well worth a mention – even an off-season visit by serious apple lovers – because it’s owned by renowned apple preservationist and historian John Bunker. Bunker has “devoted four decades of his life to tracking down rare and unusual apple varieties and preserving and propagating them all over the state, including here at his own farm,” Traverso writes. “His orchards are a living catalog of global apple varieties, and Mainers have come to savor these fruits through the ‘Out on a Limb’ heirloom apple CSA he operates each fall, with multiple pick-up locations from Portland to Mt. Desert.” LOBSTER BAKE FUNDRAISER The Maine Coast Fishermen’s Association is throwing a lobster bake Saturday on Peaks Island to raise money for its programs. The event is set for 5-7 p.m. at Island Lobster Co. on Island Avenue. Tickets are $100, available online, and include a full meal of lobster, mussels, baked potato, corn on the cob, whoopie pies and the association’s Maine Coast Monkfish Stew. Organizers said the event is limited to 100 attendees. All proceeds will go to the association.

100,10598,"Maine seaweed company bids for more growth, signs deal with business backed by celebrity chef  - Portland Press Herald","A Saco seaweed company hopes to raise $3.5 million for production upgrades while entering a deal with a new customer, backed by celebrity Tom Colicchio. Atlantic Sea Farms filed paperwork for the private financing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Sept. 23. The funding drive comes a year after Atlantic raised $3.1 million in venture capital, which helped pay for the build-out of a 27,000-square-foot processing facility in Biddeford. That’s four times the company’s previous space in Saco. The company offers a wide range of foodie products from Maine seaweed. The company started out as a mussel and kelp farm, Ocean Approved Inc. But since 2018, under the direction of CEO Briana Warner, Atlantic has expanded and now has 27 partner kelp farmers in the state, primarily lobster fishermen working in the off-season. Those harvesters brought in 970,000 pounds of kelp this year. It’s not yet clear what the new financing round might mean. An Atlantic Sea Farms spokesperson, Chief Marketing Officer Jesse Baines, said the company plans to use the proceeds to expand its markets and make innovations at the Biddeford facility, but wouldn’t disclose details. However, on the day of the SEC filing, Atlantic announced a partnership with Plant Based Seafood Co., a Virginia company that makes seafood-like products under the brand Mind Blown. Atlantic Sea Farms kelp will be added to the brand’s new Dusted Shrimp and Dusted Scallops products this month and to its Crab Cakes in 2023. The products will initially sell at more than 300 Sprouts Farmers Market grocery stores across the U.S. Mind Blown has been attracting attention for its products, winning numerous industry awards. Colicchio, judge on the Bravo TV network’s “Top Chef” series, invested in the company this spring. SEAWEED SUSTAINABILITY Both Atlantic and Plant Based are women-owned companies that tout a dedication to environmental sustainability and ocean health. The partnership is also an example of how Atlantic Sea Farms is building demand for Maine-grown seaweed among environmentally conscious consumers. Kelp improves the quality of the water where it is growing by absorbing carbon and other nutrients that otherwise could lead to algae blooms, and making water less acidic in the area it is growing. “Other brands out there are really eager to make a positive impact with their own sourcing decisions,” Baines said. “Atlantic Sea Farms really rose to the top as a partner that can help them do that.” The use of domestic seaweed is becoming a way to increase the social credibility of some companies, and branding Maine seaweed as “regenerative” is part of that trend. Atlantic Sea Farms is working with Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences, in East Boothbay, to quantify kelp’s potential for mitigating climate change and ocean acidification. Nichole Price, director of the Center for Venture Research on Seafood Solutions at Bigelow, said that Atlantic Sea Farms is working with the center and partners on several studies. One is looking into how kelp can reduce what Bigelow and the Island Institute call the “halo effect” – the weakening of shells in mussels clams and other shellfish because of ocean acidification. “That research is in the process of peer review publication that hasn’t been published yet, but we’re fairly confident in the results,” Price said. “For three years in a row at one farm in Maine, we were able to detect this halo effect. When we transplanted mussels to grow inside a kelp farm, they grew thicker, stronger shells.” These studies are now being reproduced in Alaska and Norway. In other studies with Atlantic Sea Farms, Bigelow is developing genetic tools to verify how much carbon kelp beds sequester in marine sediment and what qualities of a kelp bed contribute to its ability to sequester carbon. The lab is also working with Atlantic to study how adding seaweed to animal feed can reduce the amount of methane the animals emit. A LOBSTERING ALTERNATIVE In addition to the environmental benefits of kelp farming, Warner was drawn to its potential economic benefits for coastal communities. Before joining Atlantic, she served as the economic development director of the Island Institute in Rockland, supporting the resilience of coastal communities. There she became concerned by the state’s dependence on lobster, which she called a “monoculture” in an interview with Talking Food in Maine. “We are at an urgent and critical point right now on the coast of Maine where we need to diversify,” Warner said in the interview last year. “Lobster is going to be around in 30-40 years but it isn’t going to be what it is today. We need to diversity now, while people have capital, while they have careers on the water.” She saw that Maine’s fleet of owner-operator lobstermen are well-suited to transition into kelp growing in the winter because they are already equipped with a boat and some of the necessary gear. When she became CEO at Ocean Approved, she set to work building partnerships with fishermen, convincing them to branch out into kelp by offering them seed, training, technical assistance in obtaining leases. And to further sweeten the deal, she also offered a guarantee that Ocean Approved would buy all the kelp they could produce. The company worked to rapidly build demand for Maine-grown seaweed. Ocean Approved forged partnerships with restaurants to introduce Maine kelp as a healthy ingredient in their menus. Sweetgreen, Chef David Chang, Legal Seafood and fast-food chain B. Good were all on board. Then COVID hit, so Ocean Approved pivoted to retail, rebranded as Atlantic Sea Farms, and developed a consumer product line. It includes kelp cubes for soups and flavored ones for smoothies, fermented kelp salad and seaweed kimchi, in packaging that features stories from Maine kelp farmers. That guarantee to buy all their partners’ kelp was an important move. A 2017 benchmark study by the Maine Aquaculture Association found that only 1 in 6 seaweed farms were profitable, so it was initially a hard sell to get people interested. “I think their guarantee to buy from partner farms are critical, especially for new farmers who are learning as they go,” said Sebastian Belle, executive director of the Maine Aquaculture Association. “By guaranteeing to buy the product, Atlantic Sea Farms significantly reduces the risk to the farmer that they will invest time and money and then not be able to sell the product.” The 2017 study was done just when the sector was starting up, he said, but since then, the profitability of kelp farming has been improving steadily. The association is doing a new study now, and the results should be available by the end of the year. “I think it is pretty clear that well-run farms are profitable because more and more working waterfront families are getting into it,” Belle said. “If it was not profitable they would not take the risk.” Baines agreed, noting that one of Atlantic Sea Farms’ partner farmers made six figures last year with a four-acre farm. But kelp farming is primarily used as supplemental income right now. “It does not replace their income from fishing, but it does cushion the blow on bad seasons,” she said.",good,seaweed aquaculture,2022,Maine
101,10602,Seaweed industry divided over concerns about pace of growth in Maine  - Portland Press Herald,"When the two-day Seagriculture Conference came to Portland in September, the first time the Europe-based annual gathering has been held in the United States, a collective of 29 seaweed farmers, scientists and environmental activists from around the world took the opportunity to formally present their concerns about seaweed farming. Calling themselves Seaweed Commons, the group put forth a position paper “collectively issuing a warning call and demand for regulatory updates to mitigate risks to coastal ecosystems, the commons of the sea, the biodiversity of kelp forests, and the well-being of our human communities.” Seaweed farmer and activist Severine Fleming of Smithereen Farm in Pembroke, one of five principal authors of the paper, said Seaweed Commons fears that major seaweed aquaculture corporations, lured by the promise of big profits in the years to come, will swoop in to commandeer large swaths of Maine’s coastline. But the state’s aquaculture industry insiders consider that scenario unlikely. While parts of the U.S. coastline and some countries around the globe face different and tougher challenges to making seaweed cultivation truly sustainable, seaweed farming in Maine is already well-regulated, they say. “The issue of scale has been a little bit misrepresented in Maine,” Maine Aquaculture Association Executive Director Sebastian Belle said. “Often times, the people concerned about scale will show you a picture of farms in China where you can walk from one raft to another across a bay, pointing out that the farms are so big they’re visible from space. That is just legally impossible to happen in Maine, and would never happen.” Fears about the future of Maine’s seaweed industry have divided the industry’s proponents. While some are concerned that growing too quickly could result in irreversible damage to the coastline, others worry that, by slowing down, the state will miss out on a crucial economic opportunity that could have a significant positive impact on the environment. Fleming’s group believes the promise of seaweed cultivation and its potential to help feed the world and save the environment may be overblown. “We want to protect this space from being captured,” Fleming said after the conference, which was held in Portland because Maine has become a “hot spot for the seaweed industry in North America,” according to its organizers. “And we want to make sure there’s room for small, locally owned businesses and conservation-minded humans to undertake this work and not be crowded out and outgunned,” Fleming added. “There’s potential for real harm. It’s high stakes, actually.” “Unless there’s protection for small growers, there won’t be small growers after a certain point in time,” said Paul Molyneaux of Bangor, a former commercial fisherman who now writes about sustainable fisheries and aquaculture. “It’s like handing our oceans over to the corporations,” added Molyneaux, who also signed the Seaweed Commons paper, which draws most of its signatories from well beyond Maine, including the world-famous, pioneering farm-to-table California chef Alice Waters. A GROWING INDUSTRY Seaweed farming is on the rise both in Maine and worldwide, helping make aquaculture in general – including farmed fish and shellfish – the fastest-growing food production method in the world. The global seaweed cultivation market reached $16.7 billion last year – by comparison, the plant-based meat substitute market was valued at just under $10 billion in 2021 – and industry analysts expect that figure to reach $30.2 billion by 2027, with an annual growth rate of more than 12 percent. By contrast, all aquaculture in Maine is growing at around 2% annually, Belle said. He added that the state Department of Marine Resources’ permitting process is “very comprehensive,” designed to weed out farms that might disrupt the state’s aquaculture, economy or environment. “This idea that you’d get hundreds and hundreds of farms jammed into a particular area is just a red herring,” Belle said. “It may happen in other places, but it can’t happen here. The oversight and the checks and balances are in place, and being implemented successfully.” Belle said aquaculture critics would do well to consider perspective. “We have roughly 1,700 acres leased for aquaculture in the state of Maine, and that’s everything – salmon, mussels, oysters and seaweed,” he said. “Seventeen-hundred acres is equivalent to basically two-and-a-half potato farms in Aroostook County.” Briana Warner, chief executive officer of Atlantic Sea Farms, which partners with about 30 Maine fishermen to grow kelp, at Pine Point Beach in Scarborough in October.  Ben McCanna/Staff Photographer  “The Portland jetport takes up more space than all the seaweed farming area in Maine,” said Briana Warner, CEO of Atlantic Sea Farms, a kelp aquaculture company based in Biddeford. Warner estimated that fewer than 100 acres are farmed for seaweed in Maine. “What we’re seeing in general in aquaculture is this insidious fear of change,” Warner said. “And when people work from a point of fear rather than a point of knowledge, they create problems that don’t exist.” Some Maine seaweed scientists said a number of the broad concerns voiced by Seaweed Commons in the international collective’s position paper – including threats to the shellfish industry – don’t necessarily apply to Maine aquaculture at all, where many lobstermen supplement their income by seaweed harvesting. “The shellfish farmers and seaweed farmers are one and the same group in the Northeast,” said Nichole Price, senior research scientist at Bigelow Laboratories in East Boothbay, whose projects include helping write a 2024 report for the U.S. Congress about the state of seaweed farming science. “So to say that seaweed farming is reducing access for shellfish farming is just ill-informed.” Price said she can empathize with many of the environmental concerns in the Seaweed Commons paper, like the vulnerability monocultures have to disease and the potential introduction of invasive species that compete for nutrients with the native marine life. But like Belle, she believes Maine’s current seaweed farming regulations already address most of the group’s concerns. “There are processes in place,” Price said. “If people are worried about large-scale seaweed farms, there’s an avenue for them to talk about it and prevent it.” IS KELP THE NEW CORN' Beyond scale, Seaweed Commons activists also fear a massive bait-and-switch underway in seaweed farming worldwide, in which the drive to farm seaweed for food sources for both humans and livestock morphs into biofuel production. The extent to which biofuels, alternative renewable energy sources derived from animal waste or plant material, can benefit the environment and society is yet unclear and unproven, though they’re widely considered to have massive potential. Still, skepticism remains. “What concerns me is that (seaweed farm proponents) are selling this as food: Kelp is the new kale. But actually, kelp is the new corn ethanol. So it seems disingenuous,” Molyneaux said. Again, the concern is misplaced with regard to Maine, aquaculture proponents say. “There’s no reality to the idea of producing biofuels in Maine waters,” Warner stated. Belle said the massive volume of harvest required to produce biofuels would itself disqualify Maine, where farms lack the capacity to meet biofuel manufacturing needs. Moreover, he said the state’s excellent water quality, as measured by the Environmental Protection Agency, ensures that its seaweed harvest can be used for human consumption, unlike other U.S. coastal areas with less clean waters where growing seaweed for biofuels might be given serious consideration. Fleming said the trajectory of seaweed aquaculture reminds her of short-sighted 20th-century approaches to mining and industrial agriculture, undertaken, as it turned out, to the detriment of the planet’s health. Warner agrees that industrial agriculture is problematic. But to slow seaweed farming growth and await more studies – that Price and others say remain unduly difficult to fund in the U.S. – means Maine would miss a golden opportunity to position itself for the future, both in terms of money and the environment. “You know who’s not waiting' Fishermen,” Warner said, noting that Atlantic Sea Farms fields five to 10 queries a week from Maine fishermen interested in kelp farming. “Maine needs to be more resilient, and able to find income sources on the water besides just lobster,” Warner said. “Or in 20 years, we’re all going to look at the coast, and be like, ‘Man, we should have done something.’ In some ways, aquaculture allows us to be who we’ve always been in this state: people who work on water, and rely on natural resources.” LETTING LOBSTERMEN DIVERSIFY To Warner’s point, more and more of the state’s commercial fishermen, faced with a volatile industry, are exploring ways to diversify their income with seaweed farming. Robert Baines, 66, has fished for lobster and scallops for more than 40 years. He hasn’t done any spring lobstering for seven years because financially “it wasn’t worthwhile.” Looking for additional income to cover the loss, he took out an experimental lease three years ago for a nearly four-acre kelp farm off Spruce Head in outer Penobscot Bay. Now, as one of about 30 seaweed farmers partnered with Atlantic Sea Farms, Baines spends four days in the late fall seeding his farm, then harvests the seaweed in the spring before lobster season opens. “It fits with what I do very well,” said Baines, whose 42-foot boat lets him harvest 10,000 pounds of kelp a day. His boat had already been rigged for scalloping, including with a boom and winch that he now uses to harvest seaweed, so gear like moorings, rope and buoys have been the majority of his investment. “Every year I’ve improved, and I see room for growth,” Baines said, explaining that he harvested 20,000 pounds his first year, 40,000 the next and 60,000 last year. “We’re not making a lot of money from this, by any stretch of the imagination,” Baines added quickly. Still, the additional revenue stream has made his business more viable and better positioned for the years to come. Baines said that while good spots for kelp farms remain, the natural parameters of seaweed farming prevent massive growth. “You can’t put a kelp farm just anywhere,” he said, explaining that the farms need to be protected from winter storms, and can’t interfere with navigation or existing fisheries. “There are limited places up and down the coast you can put a kelp farm in.” Baines aims to receive a standard lease next year for an eight-acre farm overlapping his current footprint off Spruce Head, which he plans to run with his nephew, Cole Baines. The larger space will allow the Baines team to harvest as much as 120,000 pounds of kelp a year. CARBON IMPACT QUESTIONABLE  As the number of Maine seaweed farmers and the volume of kelp they harvest make steady gains, Bigelow Laboratories continues to partner with Atlantic Sea Farms to study how much atmospheric carbon the sea plants can effectively sequester, and the feasibility of using seaweed in livestock feed to reduce methane output from cows, which contributes to climate change. Early trials have shown that a tropical species of red seaweed used in feed can reduce methane emissions from cattle by more than 80 percent. “This could have a really meaningful impact on the carbon input to the atmosphere, especially given the number of cows that are farmed not only in Maine but across the globe,” Price said. Still, she cautioned that the approach has its limitations: The tropical rockweed can’t be grown here, and transporting the species around the globe would create a carbon footprint big enough to wipe out any potential gains. Fleming has strong doubts, asserting that the species of rockweed being studied “can’t be domesticated and scaled at the scale that’s being projected.” Emily Oakley, an Oklahoma farmer, past member of the National Organic Standards Board and longtime ally of Fleming’s, said she worries about the potential long-term effects of using kelp in fertilizers and livestock feed. “I think a lot of times organic farmers think – I know I did, at least – ‘I’m doing this really great thing, using kelp, this natural material’ without thinking, ‘Where does this kelp grow, and what role is it performing in this ecosystem where it grows and what happens when we remove it from that ecosystem. What’s the domino effect'’ ” Warner and others said they understand realistic concerns. But they see more reason for optimism and prudent action. Baines and his fellow kelp farmers say their seaweed sidelines benefit not just their own bottom lines, but the health of the ocean as well. “The seed we put in and the kelp we grow is good for the environment. There’s no harm to the environment at all.” “This isn’t gloom and doom out there,” Warner said. “The ocean isn’t a place of death, it’s a place of hope and opportunity. We’re not the whole answer, but it really shows that there can be a lot of hope on the water.”",bad,seaweed aquaculture,2022,Maine
102,10633,Kelp dryer could allow Maine seaweed farms to triple output  - Portland Press Herald,"A 50-foot-long, 17-ton, moisture-sucking machine from South Africa is en route to Brunswick – where the device may allow Maine seaweed companies to triple production and make an international jump of their own. Ocean’s Balance, a Biddeford seaweed farm and producer, is spending around $650,000 on the custom-designed dryer, with funding help from Coastal Enterprises Inc., a community development financial institution headquartered in Brunswick. Mitchell Lench, CEO of Ocean’s Balance, feels the investment is necessary because sugar kelp, the seaweed species most commonly farmed in Maine, requires exacting conditions in order to dry and be preserved. He believes the machine will allow his business and others along the coast to compete in the global market for seaweed, predicted to grow 12% annually and reach $30.2 billion by 2027, according to industry analysts. “This should have a knock-on effect to create more farms or bigger farms and to allow us to scale up (the seaweed industry) in a way that we have been unable to do previously,” Lench said. “Increased capacity across the industry is key.” The growth potential of Maine’s seaweed industry has been gaining attention but also has drawn criticism that an increase in farming could damage the marine environment. Regardless of the impact, increasing seaweed production is pointless if farmers can’t preserve their crops. Raw seaweed stays fresh for only about a week. Drying the plants in the sun is the primary technique for preserving them. But that’s a challenge in Maine, where the weather often doesn’t cooperate during the harvest season, from November to June. There’s also blanching and freezing, which is how Ocean’s Balance and most Maine farms currently preserve seaweed. When frozen, it takes up a lot of space, and 90% of the weight comes from water. Finding freezer storage is difficult and shipping the wet product is expensive, Lench said, limiting how much seaweed Maine farmers ultimately produce. “The freezing of seaweed around the world is not a big part of the market overall,” he added. Drying, Lench said, is far more cost-effective. Dried seaweed is also easier to mill down to powder or flakes, allowing harvesters to create a wider array of products. Milled seaweed is used in canned pet food, cosmetics, dietary supplements, seasoning blends and in flour to extend its shelf life. Seaweed is also featured in a variety of foods, including chips, crackers and slices that are eaten as a snack. SEARCHING FOR A SOLUTION Ocean’s Balance has been searching for a practical way to dry seaweed since Lench co-founded the company in 2016. The company has tried using other types of dryers, including smaller machines owned by competitors. It also worked with the University of Maine to build a dryer. But all those avenues were dead ends, Lench said, because the technology was either labor-intensive or carbon-intensive, or did not function well when handling sugar kelp. Lench found that in most dehydrators, sugar kelp would leak a sticky substance and dry unevenly at high temperatures. He hoped someone would come up with a solution, but no one ever did. “The only way we saw that the farmed seaweed market (in Maine) was going to really grow and take off was someone was going to have to invest in a dryer,” Lench said. “We finally just bit the bullet and said we need to get a dryer if we want this market to move.” The high-tech dehydrator, shown here while being assembled in South Africa, should be up and running in Brunswick before June. Photo courtesy of Ocean’s Balance  Since making that decision, Ocean’s Balance has moved fast. Lench began working with an undisclosed South African company in October 2022 to create the machinery. It was scheduled to arrive by ship in Boston on Sunday. Setting up the dryer should take about 10 days. The machine will operate in leased space at the Brunswick facility of Source Inc., a producer of seaweed-derived nutritional supplements. The dryer is the first that can create the conditions sugar kelp needs to dry properly, according to Lench. Those include specific temperatures and air pressures. Without the right drying controls, the sugar kelp can lose important nutrients as well as desirable texture, color and size. The dryer will run at 140-158 degrees Fahrenheit, the lowest temperatures that sugar kelp needs to dry without sticking and leaking. Lench said the new technology is also energy-efficient and resistant to the kelp residue. BENEFIT TO THE INDUSTRY While Ocean’s Balance expects the dryer will help increase production, the company isn’t the only business that may benefit. Source Inc. and Ocean’s Balance have launched a spin-off business called Seaweed Farmer Services, which plans to make the dryer available for the three dozen or so other seaweed farmers in the state. Collectively, they farmed 1 million pounds of kelp in 2022, according to the Maine Aquaculture Association. Ken Sparta said he and his son, who together began Spartan Sea Farms in Freeport five years ago, have spent a lot of time trying to figure out the best way to preserve their harvest. Sparta has been using a dehydrator at Replenova Farm, which grows vegetables, berries and herbs in Durham. But that machine doesn’t have the capacity or availability that Spartan needs. “What it’s limited us to is not having the resources that we need to do that (preservation),” Sparta said, adding that he expects the new dehydrator will open up many possibilities for his business. That’s what Lench is hoping, too. If all pans out for Ocean’s Balance, Maine’s seaweed industry would grow exponentially and, in turn, help the state’s ocean-based economy grow. The new machinery will be able to process 30,000 pounds of wet sugar kelp in a single day. That adds up to 3 million pounds of seaweed over the course of the 90-100 days in each harvest season. ‘IT’S GONNA BE A GAME-CHANGER’ Maine is the largest producer of harvested seaweed in the country, ahead of Alaska, which turned out 650,000 pounds last year. The U.S. seaweed business has bloomed, well, like seaweed. “Eight years ago, we were only growing about 50,000 pounds a year,” said Sebastian Belle, executive director of the Maine Aquaculture Association. “When you realize that you can grow that volume of such an amazing product … the addition of this kind of drying technology and infrastructure in the state is critical to that development.” However, the U.S. is merely a blip on the radar of the worldwide seaweed market. More than 97% of the 789 million pounds of seaweed produced in 2019 came from Asia, according to United Nations data. Lench hopes his machinery’s benefit will extend across the country. He is planning to share the dryer design with companies in Alaska to help them expand their state’s industry, too. But he won’t be showing off the plans to Maine companies or even say who built the dryer because he believes that, for now, one machine is all the state’s seaweed farmers need. Greg Tobey, left, of Source Inc. and Mitchell Lench of Ocean’s Balance are teaming up on a venture called Seaweed Farmer Services. Behind them is where they plan to install a 17-ton dehydrator, designed to preserve the harvest of Maine’s seaweed producers. Shawn Patrick Ouellette/Staff Photographer  In addition to drying the kelp, Seaweed Farmer Services plans to offer processing services, such as milling the seaweed into different forms. “We don’t view things as being a zero-sum game at this stage of the industry,” Lench said. “The whole idea behind it was to charge reasonable fees to utilize something that we’re not going to be able to utilize (completely) ourselves.” Local seaweed farmers seem to be excited about how the dryer may help their businesses grow. “I think it’s gonna be a game-changer for all of us,” Sparta said. Hugh Cowperthwaite, the senior program director of fisheries and aquaculture for Coastal Enterprises, said the dehydrator could create a swath of opportunities for harvesters to expand their businesses. He envisions a future where Maine’s harvested kelp finds its way into foods, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals around the world. Belle wants to see Maine’s sugar kelp in Slurpees or used as a condiment on popcorn, for starters. And Lench would like seaweed used in bioplastics, as an eco-friendly replacement for the petroleum-based kind. Ocean’s Balance will soon begin drying its own harvest, but the technology’s real test will come in the next harvest season. With other producers using the dehydrator, Lench said, the work will then begin to make Maine a competitor in the global market. Belle said, “Maine is really the case study at a national level for how … you develop a seaweed aquaculture sector and then how you monetize that sector in the United States.”",good,seaweed aquaculture,2023,Maine
103,10638,Letter to the editor: Seaweed ‘controversy’ wrongly overblown,"Regarding the recent story on kelp (“Kelp dryer could allow Maine seaweed farms to triple output,” May 15): Greg Tobey, left, of Source Inc. and Mitchell Lench of Ocean’s Balance are teaming up on a venture called Seaweed Farmer Services. They plan to install a 17-ton dehydrator in Brunswick, designed to preserve the harvest of Maine’s seaweed producers. Shawn Patrick Ouellette/Staff Photographer  Although perhaps controversy makes for more interesting reading, I do not agree that there is meaningful division in Maine’s seaweed industry about growth. The new kelp dryer, which will be made available to multiple businesses and farmers, illustrates that, rather than divided, the seaweed industry is collaborative and shares innovation. The feared irresponsible corporate mega-farms that animate growth opponents (mostly partisans from away) have not yet materialized here. Unless and until they do, we should be bullish about seaweed. To date, Maine’s regulatory framework, administered by the Department of Marine Resources, has effectively protected the marine environment while permitting responsible aquaculture activities. Maine is already the leading state in seaweed farming. Projected annual growth and greater market share should excite those who view the success of our fishery as success for all Mainers. Large-scale aquaculture farms are not categorically harmful. We should be evaluating any project based on facts and data rather than “big” or “small.” A small, local food economy is beautiful but plainly will not feed the world’s population into the next century. With recent 80% cuts to the haddock quota and legal and political battles around the right whale and offshore renewable energy, a diverse, dynamic and data-driven fishery will best position Maine not only to be resilient and sustainable, but also to be a global Blue Economy leader.

104,10639,"$30 million project will expand footprint, capacity of Bigelow research center in East Boothbay ","The Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences is undertaking a $30 million expansion of its campus in East Boothbay, saying the build-out will add sorely needed space for the lab’s scientists and broaden its research and teaching capabilities. The planned 25,000-square-foot center for “ocean education and innovation” will increase Bigelow’s footprint off Ocean Point Road by more than 40% and include new lab facilities and classrooms. Also slated is a two-story, 300-seat gathering space for programs and public events. The project breaks ground in October, with a target finish date in spring 2025.  Bigelow is a nonprofit, independent oceanography institute, exploring scientific topics that range from marine microbes to the large-scale processes that drive ecosystems and the health of the planet. In advance of announcing the expansion Thursday, the lab’s president and CEO, Deborah Bronk, discussed the project with the Press Herald. “We’re bursting at the seams at Bigelow,” she said. The lab has had to squeeze four or five people into each office and “educational programs often temporarily oust a few scientists from their laboratory space.” When Bigelow moved to its current location in 2012, the laboratory had about 60 employees. Just over a decade later, staffing has doubled to around 120. In the summer, with students, interns and visiting scientists, the campus population is closer to 160. The roomier digs will help, and Bronk is especially excited about the gathering space known as “the forum.” The need for the hall was outlined in the lab’s strategic plan. “To highlight Bigelow’s scientific leadership and to bring the world’s other scientific leaders to the laboratory, Bigelow must have the ability to host scientific workshops and conferences of 100 to 200 participants,” the plan reads.  “Discussions with community leaders in the surrounding region has uncovered an urgent need for conference space. If that space was at Bigelow Laboratory, it would generate revenue and bring people to our campus, which is challenging but critically important for fundraising.” A rendering of the front of Bigelow Laboratory shows the new entrance and the planned expansion to the right. The 25,000-square-foot addition is expected to be completed in spring 2025.  Courtesy of Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences  The expansion is being funded by a variety of sources, including an $8 million gift from the Harold Alfond Foundation, $12 million in federal funding and $9 million from individual and institutional donors. Bigelow had an operating budget of about $16.9 million in 2021. Fundraising will continue through June 2024, and the new center will be named after that work is completed. Bigelow was founded in 1974, six years after the Portland-based Gulf of Maine Research Institute. Both are considerably younger than two other well-known independent research labs in Maine, the MDI Biological Laboratory (founded in 1898) and The Jackson Laboratory (founded in 1929). Those two are located in Bar Harbor, where they are large economic drivers. Bronk hopes that, similarly, the new expansion will be a boon for Boothbay. “In the shoulder seasons, bringing people to Boothbay is great. We need to bring people not just in July and August,” she said. A CRITICAL TIME FOR SCIENCE The announcement of the new center comes as the need for ocean research is increasing, Bronk said. Because Bigelow is not tied to a university, the lab remained in operation when schools shut down at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Bigelow thrived during this period, Bronk said, but so many closed laboratories “set research back in this country.” As climate change continues, she believes the importance of the work that Bigelow scientists and other oceanic researchers conduct will only grow. The laboratory has been expanding its research on seaweed and shellfish aquaculture, carbon dioxide removal techniques and ocean forecasts powered by artificial intelligence – all work that can expand with the additional space and resources, Bronk said. Currently, Bigelow’s campus has three wings: the Walter and Helen Norton Center for Blue Biotechnology, the Center for Ocean Biogeochemistry and Climate Change, and the Center for Ocean Health. The planned fourth wing also will expand opportunities for business innovation, Bronk said, since government funding for two of the wings prohibits commercial research there. For example, Bigelow’s National Center for Marine Algae and Microbiota is a distributor of marine algae for scientists and has sold its cultures in 58 counties. It also offers consulting, contracted research and intellectual property development. This commercialization helps the nonprofit laboratory fund additional research.  The new wing also will provide designated space for administrative and business operations, which for years have been housed in temporary modular buildings. The modular buildings will be moved offsite and converted into affordable housing. “We didn’t want to put (them) in a landfill,” Bronk said. PREPARING THE NEXT GENERATION Ben Twining, Bigelow’s vice president for education, said the new center’s two 20-person teaching classrooms and two teaching laboratories will allow more students to participate in hands-on, scientist-led programs. In the past, these have been limited to groups of 10 or fewer students, with only one program underway at a time.  The expansion may also allow greater opportunities for professional development. Each summer Bigelow runs a popular college research internship program for about 25 undergraduate students. The lab also hosts the Keller BLOOM program, a four-day summer workshop for Maine teachers who have an interest in teaching ocean sciences to middle and high school students. “Because so many people want to be here in the summer, it has put pressure on us, trying to fit those programs in at the same time,” Twining said.  An aerial photo shows the current Bigelow Laboratory campus in East Boothbay. Photo by Yoon S. Byun  The expansion will make it easier to work with both groups, and with more funding and room Bigelow soon may be able to open the BLOOM program to teachers beyond Maine. In addition, Twining said there will be more collaboration with a new 48-foot research vessel Bigelow acquired from Middlebury College last year. Now the lab will be able to bring students on the water to collect samples, then bring them back to the campus for analysis and teaching. With expanded facilities and personnel, Bigelow also will be able to engage with a broader range of other educational organizations around the state. For example, last year the state launched the Maine Outdoor Learning Initiative, an effort to increase access to hands-on outdoor learning experiences for Maine students. Funding is provided to Maine nonprofits specializing in coastal education, ocean ecology, marine science and marine center programming. “We’ve had the desire and the interest to participate in things like that,” Twining said, “but we haven’t had the resources. I’m excited to expand our own programs and be able to serve as a resource for other (organizations) as well.”",good,seaweed aquaculture,2023,Maine
105,10652,"Commentary: With or without Maine, seaweed revolution is taking off ","Maine’s cold, clear waters are an ideal environment to farm kelp. It acts as an underwater forest that absorbs carbon and nitrogen, as well as creates habitat for marine life. In many ways, it’s the perfect crop and a valuable tool to fight climate change. A line of seaweed is hauled aboard a barge for harvesting off Cumberland. Maine, which harvested over 1 million pounds of kelp last year, is welcoming the international Seagriculture USA conference to Portland on Wednesday and Thursday. Robert F. Bukaty/Associated Press, file  Mitchell Lench is the CEO of Ocean’s Balance, a vertically integrated seaweed company based in Biddeford. He has been a trustee of the Maine chapter of The Nature Conservancy for the past six years. As the largest producer of farmed kelp in the U.S., and with a 50-year history in wild seaweed harvesting, Maine is seen as a leader in the U.S. seaweed economy. There are over 40 farms across the coast, and Maine farmers harvested over 1 million pounds of kelp in 2022. On Wednesday and Thursday, Maine is welcoming the Seagriculture USA conference for a second year. This international seaweed innovation conference is bringing hundreds of people from across the globe to Portland to learn how Maine is building its sustainable aquaculture industry. It’s also an opportunity for Maine to learn best practices from other countries and states like Alaska. In Maine, the current momentum is now carrying to the next level of the seaweed economy, with Maine companies positioned at the forefront of advanced processing of seaweed as a replacement for plastic packaging, as a mineral-rich food and in medicine and agriculture. It’s a model for sustainable economic development, and if we get it right, it can offer a vital new sector to the Maine economy with high-paying biotech jobs coupled with keeping traditional fisherwomen and fishermen working on the water. There is a need to develop ways to grow and process larger volumes of cultivated seaweed. We’ve made a start by investing in the largest kelp dryer in North America, now operating out of Brunswick. This state-of-the-art machine can process up to 30,000 pounds of seaweed a day. A shared model makes the dehydrator available to all kelp farmers and companies, giving them the ability to get more value from their kelp. Seaweed is increasingly being included in human and pet food, animal feed, supplements, cosmetics and more. There are also startup companies in Maine that are now moving that kelp into the lab, and they are producing plastic alternatives, PFAS substitutes and plant biostimulants that improve nutrient uptake, quality and yield. Maine’s economic development organizations, including the Maine Technology Institute, are actively investing in Maine’s seaweed economy by offering grants, loans and equity investments to companies that are innovators in the industry, but we can do more. Maine can stay on top of this important, emerging industry – we have a vast coastline, committed companies, top-tier research and educational institutions, and innovators looking to seaweed not just as a value-add but also an integral part of Maine’s blue economy. But we need to recognize that the seaweed revolution is taking off with or without us. The economic implications for Maine is a decidedly important part of this story, but the bigger picture is the impact seaweed can have on our climate. It goes well beyond the carbon that is sequestered by growing seaweed. Seaweed will obviously not solve the climate crisis, but it could help sustainably feed people and animals, replace plastics, decarbonize the economy, rebuild marine ecosystems, and provide high-tech and replace disappearing marine jobs.",good,seaweed aquaculture,2023,Maine
106,10656,Seaweed could be added to Maine’s blue carbon stock ,"Maine is one of the first states to consider the carbon storage potential of seaweed in its carbon budget, a biennial accounting of the balance between locally produced greenhouse gas emissions and the amount of carbon being safely stored in the environment. The carbon budget already considers the storage capacity of Maine forests, which cover 89% of the state. Forests absorb atmospheric carbon through photosynthesis and store 412 million metric tons of carbon in the trees themselves and a whopping 1.6 billion metric tons of carbon in their soils. The state carbon budget, which was first introduced in Maine’s last greenhouse gas report, also includes traditional blue carbon sources like salt marshes and eelgrass beds, which have high carbon storage rates but not as much impact as forests because they aren’t as plentiful. The impact of blue carbon could grow, however, if the board that oversees rule changes at the Maine Department of Environmental Protection grants the agency’s request to add seaweed to the method it uses to calculate its annual greenhouse gas emissions. Some of the members of the Board of Environmental Protection who heard the proposal Thursday were clearly surprised to learn that seaweed had any carbon storage potential, and were more familiar with the traditional role of green carbon sequestration. “I’ve witnessed kelp get battered by storms and going into little bits,” said board member Barbara Vickery of Richmond, a conservation biologist who spent 33 years with the Nature Conservancy. “The idea of it being buried in the sense of sequestering that we think of soils, does that happen'” According to Stacy Knapp, who produces the DEP’s biennial emissions inventory, the answer is yes, but it’s more complicated than forest carbon storage, and much of the science on how this will be calculated is evolving. “Some of this organic material will be eaten by zooplankton or other animals and then excreted out as snow,” Knapp said, “that can be eaten by another organism or sometimes it falls all the way to the ocean floor and it is in fact buried.” Kelp being grown by Ocean Approved floats underwater near a raft off the coast of Chebeague Island in 2014.  Gregory Rec/Staff Photographer  Lush seaweed beds, or macroalgae, can be found in the cold, nutrient-rich waters along Maine’s rocky shore. These underwater meadows use sunlight to absorb carbon dioxide and make sugars through photosynthesis, and provide food and habitat for marine animals. Seaweed stores carbon in its blades. Over time, the sea absorbs atmospheric carbon dioxide to replace what the seaweed took in. But without roots, seaweed can’t sink carbon into the seabed like a forest can with soil. It releases carbon when it’s buffeted by waves, is eaten by marine life or is harvested. That explains why scientists didn’t initially consider seaweed to be a viable blue carbon candidate. In fact, some scientists still believe that wild mature seaweed beds can, under normal conditions, release more carbon than they sequester. But researchers began to reassess seaweed’s storage potential when they found traces of macroalgae carbon in deep-sea sediments. They now believe seaweed fragments drift and sink to such depths that they are sequestered, far beyond the reach of any current. Nichole Price, a senior research scientist at Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences, is leading the U.S. component of an Oceans 2050 study that has found seaweed carbon deposition under two dozen active agricultural seaweed farms spanning five continents, from Maine to China. “There is still so much we don’t know,” Price said. “Seaweed has no stock assessment. We don’t have a list of species by state or country. But the data is clear: it can store carbon, both in the wild and when it’s farmed. Now we need more data.” To estimate its seaweed carbon storage potential, Maine must first map its wild beds and determine carbon sequestration rates for each species. After deposition rates are set, storage values can then be assigned to Maine’s state-permitted seaweed farms based on state landings data. That won’t be possible until the state’s next greenhouse gas emissions report is published, which is expected to come out in January, but writing seaweed into the rule that lays out how greenhouse gas emissions are calculated will drive the research needed to quantify its storage potential. In 2019, Maine enacted legislation that set a goal of reducing gross greenhouse gas emissions to 45% below 1990 levels by 2030 and to 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. Later that year, Gov. Janet Mills signed an executive order to achieve carbon neutrality in Maine by 2045. The last carbon budget indicates Maine is approximately 75% of the way to being carbon neutral, which means 75% of the greenhouse gases emitted in 2016 are balanced by environmental sequestration in forests, soils and blue carbon sinks such as salt marshes.",good,seaweed aquaculture,2023,Maine
107,10684,Bigelow to break ground on algae ‘greenhouse’ | Boothbay Register,"Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences will be breaking ground on a new Marine Algal Research and Innovation Accelerator (MARIA) on its campus in East Boothbay later this spring. The program’s goal is to find commercial applications for marine algae use, said Darlene Crist, Director of Communications for Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences. Crist said that Maine Technology Institute provided $5,000 in seed grant funds. Another $100,000 was provided by the federal government through the Department of Agriculture, and Maine Community Foundation loaned the facility $300,000 to get the greenhouse built and operational. The algal facility will also capitalize on a prior relationship between Mike Lomas, director of the National Center for Marine Algae at Bigelow, and Field Energy LLC, which is a private company trying to develop a process to improve fatty acid products. These acids are important in brain development in children, and they also reduce cardiovascular disease in adults. Lomas’ team and Field Energy had been working for some time on the research, together with Bigelow Analytic Services. The funding enabled the partnership to provide “one stop shopping” for research and development of algae products. The pilot project, which will be online in the fall, should be able to grow enough algae to explore new commercial products, benefiting the world’s people, as well as aquaculture in Maine. Lomas said that MARIA will not only grow algae, but will also be a center for developing universal algal standards, and exploring new ways that algae can be incorporated into products. The support from MTI, the Department of Agriculture, and Maine Community Foundation’s loan from its Food, Fisheries, and Farms program will provide for the construction of a roughly 3,000 square foot pilot-scale production greenhouse on Bigelow Laboratory’s ocean science campus on the Damariscotta River.  Lomas’ team has already constructed a mini-scale production facility in the Seawater Suite at Bigelow Laboratory to test growth processes for scaling up once the larger facility is operational.  “My hope is that the greenhouse will serve as a flywheel that drives innovation. It will accelerate the process of taking ideas for natural products created using micro and macro algae and turning them into concepts,” added Lomas. “The greenhouse will allow us to help other entrepreneurs regardless of where they might be in the process.” Because of the quantity of algae it will be able to produce, MARIA also will be developing algal standards by providing a consistent source of material. The ultimate goal is to provide not only algae that are predictable, but also to assist Maine’s young aquaculture community to expand into fields they may not have tried before. Maine is something of the epicenter for non-fisheries aquaculture in the United States, and the midcoast is the hub of that effort, according to Maine Aquaculture Innovation Center, an industry group that represents aquaculture businesses in Maine. Locally, Maine Fresh Sea Farms in Bristol produces three kinds of seaweed as food. Marshall Wharf Brewing in Belfast uses some of its sugar kelp to make beer. Pemaquid Mussel Farm is also growing seaweed along with its mussel beds. Statewide, there are already 20 companies that harvest seaweed, bringing in some 17.7 million pounds in 2014, the most ever recorded, according to the group. But in addition to these “macro algaes,” there are many microscopic algaes, too. Some have been harvested for many years, such as the shells of diatoms, pulverized and used as a natural, nontoxic pesticide known as diatomaceous earth. Red algaes are the basis for agar, used in laboratories as a culture medium, and carrageenin, a compound used as a stabilizing agent in foods, pharmaceuticals, and paints. Brown algaes are also used as thickening agents and stabilizing agents. In addition to making stable fatty acids such as Omega 3s, microalgae may provide an important fuel source in years to come.",good,seaweed aquaculture,2016,Maine
108,10696,Café Scientifique: ‘Is seafood secure?’ | Boothbay Register,"Seafood is a primary food source for billions of people around the world. Unfortunately, demand for seafood has given rise to overfishing and other unsustainable harvesting practices. Seafood security will continue to be a major issue in the Gulf of Maine and around the world as our seaweed, shellfish, and finfish resources are threatened by declining ocean health. For ocean lovers and conscientious consumers, it can be difficult to make informed choices about which seafood products are both “safe” and “sustainable.” To further discuss this topic, Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences will host the next lecture of the 2016 Café Scientifique series on Tuesday, Aug. 16, from 6 to 7 p.m. The lecture will be presented by Dr. Nichole Price and will discuss the question, “Is seafood secure'”  Price is a senior research scientist at Bigelow Laboratory who studies marine ecology. She is particularly interested in seaweed health and the role edible “sea greens” play in the marine carbon cycle. Price is also the director of Bigelow Laboratory’s new Center for Venture Research for Seafood Security, a program that works to assess the safety and sustainability of wild-harvested and aquacultured seafood. The center’s goal is to partner with policy makers, industry members, and the general public to solve pressing problems and translate cutting-edge science for informed decision making in legislative branches and at restaurants and seafood counters. Scientific diving is another important part of Price’s research. Bigelow Laboratory is a member institution of the American Academy of Underwater Sciences, and Price has been involved in diving projects in the Central Pacific and the Gulf of Maine. This event is free and open to the public. Members of the press are encouraged to attend. All 2016 Café Scientifique lectures will be held at Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences, located at 60 Bigelow Drive in East Boothbay. Lectures will also be live-streamed at live.bigelow.org.

109,10698,Managed harvests in the Kennebec Estuary: Aquaculture | Boothbay Register,"The Kennebec Estuary Land Trust (KELT) continues their annual Environmental Lecture Series on Thursday, Nov. 3 at the Maine Maritime Museum starring energetic innovators doing aquaculture in Maine. This is the second program in a fall series titled, Forest, Food, Fishery: Managed Harvests in the Kennebec Estuary. The evening opens at 6:30 p.m. with a complimentary tasting of several types of fresh, locally raised oysters and sea vegetables. Then at 7 p.m., a series of presenters will discuss the exciting present and buoyant future of cultivating seaweed and oysters in the state. The complimentary tasting of fresh locally raised Maine oysters and sea vegetables will be shucked, served and described by the folks who grew them including Abigail Carrol of Nonesuch Oyster Company, John Swenson of Nice Oysters, and Jared Kramer of Winnegance Oyster Farm. Please RSVP to Becky Kolak (bkolak@kennebecestuary.org or 207-442-8400) to attend the tasting. Opening the evening's presentations, Dr. Chris Davis, executive director of Maine Aquaculture Innovation Center, will describe the trends and opportunities in Maine aquaculture. The Center was established in 1988 by the Maine Legislature with a mission to assist in developing economically and environmentally sustainable aquaculture opportunities in Maine. Dr. Davis oversees dozens of research projects funded by the Center, conducts a research grants program, and manages two aquaculture business incubators, as well as being a partner in Pemaquid Oyster Company in the Damariscotta River. He has said, “Aquaculture as practiced in Maine is wholly sustainable whether it be salmon, oyster or kelp farming.” Brandon Sewall grows a sea vegetable off Phippsburg called Sugar Kelp (Saccharina latissima); the long strands of cultured kelp create a vertical marine forest, providing habitat for marine animals and a product that he harvests for local farmers both as compost enrichment and a nutritional supplement for animal feed. He views kelp aquaculture as a way to clean the water and help the soils, and sees potential to help oceans worldwide through aquaculture. Maine’s oyster industry includes more than 50 farms along the coast from the Piscataqua River to Taunton Bay, and inherit flavors from the waters in which they were grown. Maine-native Abigail Carroll at Nonesuch Oyster grows American (Crassostrea virginica) and European Flat (Ostrea edulis, otherwise known as ‘Bélon’) varieties using traditional, environmentally-safe, grow-out methods. Ms Carroll is a third generation Maine entrepreneur. Before starting Nonesuch Oyster Company, Abigail worked in finance and then in numerous start-ups in industries ranging from telecoms to fashion. Her oysters are grown off Scarborough and are part of the developing Maine Oyster Trail where connoisseurs can visit and sample fresh product from a growing list of Maine entrepreneurs. Jordan Kramer runs Winnegance Oyster Farm on the New Meadows River and runs a popular oyster CSA as well as selling direct-from-the-farmer at his Portland farm stand. He will discuss the federally funded research he is conducting at his farm to test two new growing methods that are designed to use tidal flux to passively clean and tumble oysters, reducing one of the most troublesome aspects of oyster farming.

110,10729,Research into cattle methane solutions bolstered by $5M grant | Boothbay Register,"A new $5 million grant will support the efforts of Bigelow Laboratory scientists to reduce methane emission by cattle — one of the largest human-caused sources of the greenhouse gas. The researchers are leading a team of partners from throughout the Northeast that hopes to use algae-based feed supplements to reduce cattle’s environmental impact.  Methane is a greenhouse gas more than 28 times as potent as carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere. Cows burp out significant amounts of methane as part of their natural digestive process. However, research from Bigelow Laboratory has shown that adding algae additives to their diet can greatly reduce these emissions. Given the size and scope of the dairy and beef industries, this could have a major global impact.  Bigelow Laboratory began work on this issue in 2019 with a grant from the Shelby Cullom Davis Charitable Fund. The new grant from the organization will build upon the project’s success to date — and add critical new environmental impact components to the effort to develop algae-based feed supplements. “We have developed ways to interrupt the mechanisms behind cattle’s methane emissions,” said Nichole Price, a senior research scientist at Bigelow Laboratory and the project lead. “Now we're going to figure out how to optimize our strategy and apply it in a way that can work globally.”  The new funding allows the researchers to explore solutions to the largest roadblock to the approach: scalability. The team has demonstrated success with feed trials of individual herds, but addressing the emissions on a signal farm won’t make a dent in the emissions of the more than one billion cows on the planet. In order to make a real difference, the supplement must be able to be produced in large quantities and at a reasonable enough cost. “Other groups’ research on this idea has primarily focused on a single species of seaweed that has the right effect on methane, but could not be produced at the scale needed to address this problem,” Price said. “A workable solution needs to be accessible to everyone.”   In their search for a solution, Price and her team are focused on one of the world’s most productive marine ecosystems – the Gulf of Maine. Maine is home to more than 250 species of seaweed, a burgeoning aquaculture industry, and Bigelow Laboratory’s repository of algal strains from all over the globe. These elements make it an ideal testing ground for exploring algal solutions that can be applied worldwide. The new funding allows the team to look into algae solutions that could realistically be produced in the quantities needed to address the global issue and create an accessible, environmentally-friendly product. “This grant allows us to take the critical next steps in solving this problem,” Price said. “We believe that the science behind this idea is sound, but the true challenge is developing a realistic solution that can address this problem of such an incredible magnitude.” A wide variety of expertise is needed, and Price has forged new collaborations with partners from research, industry, and academia. NutraSteward is helping the team navigate theFDA certification process and The William H. Miner Agricultural Research Institute will help complete the necessary feed trials. Students and faculty from Colby College are assisting with economics research, and collaborators from Clarkson University are evaluating the net carbon impact of the entire proposed solutions – from growing seaweed to packaging the products. “The new parts of this project will complement our existing search for the right seaweed solution,” Price said, “and enable us to look into some creative ways that we can use what we’re learning to actually solve this global problem.”",good,seaweed aquaculture,2021,Maine
111,10741,Sea and Science Center gives students a ‘kelping’ hand in aquaculture | Boothbay Register,"In September, Boothbay Sea and Science Center provided 10 Maine schools with aquariums and seedlings as part of a seaweed growth studying project. The students grew sugar kelp, alaria, or both in their tanks, which were filled with either filtered sea water or manmade seawater with deionized water with salt, also known as instant ocean.   In December, Center staff replanted the students’ experimental seedlings into three Midcoast locations  (East Boothbay, Clark Cove in Damariscotta and Casco Bay). Other participating schools who harvested their seaweed planted either at Clark Cove or Casco Bay included South Bristol, Greenville Consolidated, Medomak Middle, Lincoln Academy, Lisbon Middle, Greely Middle, and Bergstrom home school in Harpswell. On May 5, Boothbay Region, Southport Central and Edgecomb Eddy elementary school students harvested their seaweed near the Center. At 10 a.m., Edgecomb and Boothbay Region students harvested their seaweed. Boothbay Region students harvested their sugar kelp and alaria. Edgecomb harvested sugar kelp. At 12:15, Southport Central students harvested sugar kelp and alaria.  After the harvest, students examined how the ocean climate impacted their former seedings. Center Executive Director Pauline Dion explained the project’s educational value. “This project shows students how seaweed grows,” she said. “They realize it grows like a plant, and observe its growth by fertilizing it, and making sure it receives proper nutrients. They record data, and share with other participating schools their findings to see how various factors influence the growth.” This is the program’s fifth year. It began in the winter of 2017 with Edgecomb science educator Sarah Currier and Seth Barker, co-owner of Maine Sea Farms. The two planted seedlings at Barker’s farm. In 2022, the program was partly funded by an Onion Foundation grant.

112,11069,"Top stories of year focused on fisheries, ferry and healthcare","With the new year bearing  a new current of news, The Quoddy Tides looks back on 2019 for the top stories of the day as reported at the time.  Sometimes the issues represent a startling change, welcome or otherwise, or  represent one point in a progression of events that will likely surface again  in the future. Island ferry  service reveals layers of need A story with many layers  that continues to play out and may well for years to come is the question of a  year‑round ferry for Campobello Island. The New Brunswick community is  connected to the U.S. mainland by the international bridge in Lubec but has no  year‑round ferry service that would allow transport within Canada rather than  requiring two border crossings and over an hour's drive to get from the island  to the Canadian border just one‑way. Loss of population and summer tourism,  difficulties transporting medical supplies or even building supplies and septic  system pumping services are just a few of the issues that islanders face  because of the lack of direct transportation within their own country. In May readers learned  that a summer ferry service between Deer Island and Campobello would return  after a year's absence. However, in late September, a new issue came to light  that has since garnered national attention in the United States and Canada.  Canadian mail, brought overland by Canada Post in a bonded carrier to the  island, was and still is being opened and searched when it crosses the U.S.  border at the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) station in Calais. CBP  officers can open packages and letters, which may contain private information  such as credit card numbers or medical records, and can also confiscate any  products that are illegal under U.S. federal laws, including cannabis, which is  now legal in Canada. Since the September 27 article was published, various  entities have been working to reach a solution. Natural resources  ebb and flow. After a two‑year wait, on  March 28 the Maine Supreme Judicial Court upheld a lower court decision that  rockweed harvesters must obtain permission from upland landowners before  harvesting in the intertidal area. The court applied prior legal precedent in  reaching its conclusion that the harvesting of rockweed does not fall within  the public's right to fishing, fowling or navigating, as outlined in a 1641‑47  colonial ordinance. Seaweed, the decision clarifies, is not considered fish and  does not fall within reasonable access permitted in the three activities  described by the colonial ordinance. However, the justices argued that the 1989  Moody Beach court decision, used in part as the basis for their decision,  erroneously limited the public's use of the intertidal zone.      As  noted in one of the opinions issued, ""A member of the public has been  allowed to stroll along the wet sands of Maine's intertidal zone holding a gun  or a fishing rod, but not holding the hand of a child.""Also in March was the  announcement by Cooke Aquaculture of plans to build a $30 million recirculating  aquaculture system in the Champlain Industrial Park located in Bayside, near  St. Andrews. It will employ about 15 people and will be used to grow salmon  larger on land, prior to their transfer to saltwater farming pens. In a significant move to  restore sea‑run alewives to their historic spawning grounds in the St. Croix  River watershed, in early June Woodland Pulp opened the fishway at the West  Grand Lake Dam, complying with an order by the Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission. The opening of the fishway had been urged by federal agencies, the  Passamaquoddy Tribe and the Schoodic Riverkeepers, while fishing guides on West  Grand Lake and the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife had  opposed the move. Edward Bassett of the tribe's environmental department at  Sipayik said, ""It will bring back the biomass of protein fish available  for food for not just people but for the whole ecosystem, including the Gulf of  Maine.""Fishermen in the lobster  industry faced a bait crisis, as reported at the end of July. The crisis was  leading them to cut expenses, set traps later in the spring and consider  pulling them earlier in the fall. The crisis was mainly caused by the slashing  of the herring quota, including an 84% cut for the inshore Gulf of Maine. The  cost of herring bait rose from $34 to $44 a bushel in 2018 to about $86 a  bushel in 2019, which was considered just above the line of expenses exceeding  revenues.As reported in early  August, urchin fishermen were also facing pressures when the Maine Department  of Marine Resources (DMR) cut the eastern Maine Zone 2 season from 38 to 30  days. The DMR said that urchin abundance has  declined every year since 2014. In 2019 it was roughly half what it was in  2017. The fisheries were still  in the news at the end of August with lobster fishermen sparring with fishery  regulators and conservationists over proposed rules to limit endangered right  whale entanglements in fishing gear. The National Marine Fisheries Service has  decided on a take reduction target of 60% for the New England lobster fishery  to reduce serious injuries and mortalities in the U.S. commercial fisheries to  less than one right whale a year. Two more public input sessions were expected  before rule‑making would start in 2020. Back on land, the Arauco  mill planned to eliminate about 65 jobs at its St. Stephen facility, with about  120 jobs remaining. The company makes Fibrex, a high‑density particle‑board.  The company planned to add value to its product by manufacturing wainscoting and  further product development for 2020. The company hoped that product  development could lead to rebuilding employment in the future but in the  meantime had offered early retirement and severance packages to workers on the  Fibrex line, which it hoped would lead to some openings for some of the people  facing unemployment. In early December  came the news that Connors Bros., based in Blacks Harbour, might be purchased  by a Taiwan company, FCF Co. Ltd. The last remaining sardine cannery in North  American is part of Bumble Bee Parent Inc. and four affiliated companies that  filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the U.S. in late November. Connors Bros.  employs about 600 workers in New Brunswick, primarily at the Blacks Harbour  facility. Healthcare faces  multiple pressures In late January caring for  the mental health needs of the county's elderly was on the mind of Nathan  Brown, interim administrator of the Eastport Memorial Nursing Home. Dementia  and its many aspects are part of a gradual progression, he noted, and it's  probably one of the toughest issues facing the nursing home community. While  geriatric mental healthcare was never the intention of nursing home care, it  has become the norm because of the age of residents entering the system. Many  times pre‑existing mental health conditions can be disguised by dementia,  complicating diagnosis and treatment. The lack of geriatric psychiatric  facilities combined with the state and county's aging population compounds the  problem, he explained. The alarm bells were  ringing about teen and youth use of e‑cigarettes, or ""vaping,"" by the  Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Healthy Acadia at a  presentation held at Calais Regional Hospital in early March. While smoking  traditional cigarettes at the high school level declined from 40% in 1997 to  10% in 2017, the CDC reported the use of e‑cigarettes, or vaping, by teens had  increased by at least 20% in 2018. Healthy Acadia personnel felt that, since  the CDC figures, the rate had increased to 30% by early 2019. Flavors such as  cotton candy and gummy bear are used by the e‑cigarette industry in what  appears to be an effort targeting youth, causing the Federal Drug  Administration to threaten action if the industry didn't stop using such  flavors in its products. A standard e‑cigarette pod contains the nicotine of a  standard pack of cigarettes and, in addition, uses chemicals in its delivery  system with questionable health benefits at the least, and in the case of  formaldehyde, a known carcinogenic. Also in March was the  first of a number of reports of escalating difficulties at Calais Regional  Hospital (CRH). CRH and the Maine State Nurses Association were negotiating  contracts, with the association pointing to cuts to pay, decreases in  discretionary time off and more. CRH contended that negotiations were ongoing  and that its goal is to provide high‑quality care and honor its financial  responsibilities. Down East Community Hospital in Machias was not immune to  nursing contract issues, with a report in late July showing that contract  negotiations had started in October 2018 and appeared to be stalled. In late September CRH  filed for bankruptcy because of financial challenges related to lower patient  volume, decreased reimbursements, an increased rate of free care and bad debt,  rising regulatory requirements and a difficulty in recruiting permanent  providers. Despite these challenges, CRH had steadily decreased its losses from  $2.64 million in 2014 to $574,600 in 2018. Filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy was  a ""necessary step"" in achieving financial stability, CRH asserted. CRH and Down East  Community Hospital joined forces, as reported in late November, to change their  contracted service for emergency department and hospitalist providers from the  Maine‑based BlueWater to the Tennessee‑based Envision Physician Services in  February 2020. The new service provider's parent company, Envision Healthcare,  was one of the two largest backers funding opposition in 2019 to a proposed  federal law to end out‑of‑network charges, or ""surprise billing."" The  proposed law had the support of Congress and President Donald Trump. Surprise  billing can happen when a person receives care at an in‑network facility but  receives care from a provider who is out‑of‑network. The patient believes they  are in‑network, but isn't, and is on the hook for what can be often by  significant costs. This type of billing was of particular concern with  emergency departments because Maine law does not completely address the issue,  with balance billing causing additional problems because the provider can still  bill the patient for the difference between the provider's charge and the  allowed amount paid by insurance. The many roads to  employment. The Downeast Correctional  Facility in Bucks Harbor was back in the news at the end of April with the  legislature contemplating two bills on the pre-release center's future. At the  public hearings held for the bills, Department of Corrections Commissioner  Randall Liberty testified that the department had made the decision to move forward  with a pre‑release center, but not at the existing but closed campus. Rep. Will  Tuell of East Machias said, ""I believe we are missing out if we go with a  scaled‑down facility somewhere other than Bucks Harbor."" He continued,  ""We had a facility that worked and really don't need a knock‑off."" In  early May, many in the Downeast area were relieved to hear that Governor Janet  Mills and the Washington County delegation had reached an agreement to build a  new pre‑release center on the existing campus. The pre‑release model is for low‑security  inmates in the last few years of their sentence who learn valuable job skills  through work‑release opportunities and other programs. A long‑vacant storefront  in downtown Machias was in the news in early October as the future home of the  Machias Valley Center for Entrepreneurship. The center will be for community  members to explore entrepreneurship models with a business incubator program,  classes and workshops. It will also have co‑working space available by  membership fee that will provide office and meeting room space and equipment  and technology necessary for running a business. In early November a  profile of a number of telecommuters showed the benefits of far better  information technology infrastructure than was found just 10 years ago.  Telecommuters ran the gamut from those near retirement who moved to the region  and continued to work full- or part‑time in their new homes with translation  services and data science, to Washington County natives returning to their much‑loved  roots and quality of life while bringing with them high‑caliber work in  architectural drafting or study‑abroad travel programming.",neutral,seaweed aquaculture,2020,Maine
